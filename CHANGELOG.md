    applied anymore, you need to change styles to props we had the need of moving `resizeMode` and
    `borderRadius` from inside of style prop to be props itself default for `resizeMode` was ` cover`` before in the code of react-native-elements, as it is the default for React Native  `Image`

    network connection, instead of using the default https://clients3.google.com/generate_204
    - see: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-netinfo#netinfoconfiguration
    - if the mainserver is down, `isInternetReachable` gets false now and we can react to
      that information
      - the `graphqlFetchPolicy` depends now also on the information of the uptime of the mainserver
      - if the mainserver is down, the app needs to use cached date
  - added `isMainserverUp` to the NetworkContext, which will be available next to `isConnected`
    across the app
    - added `isMainserverUp` in addition to `isConnected` in every component that uses
      the `graphqlFetchPolicy`-helper to determine the fetch policy depending on the network state

Updated Expo SDK to 34.0.0 and bumped different packages to be more up to date

- Read about that step in: https://blog.expo.io/expo-sdk-34-is-now-available-4f7825239319

## [v1.0.7]

Add namespace to secrets for multiple domains

### Added

- added access to secrets per namespace
  - namespace is used form slug given in app.json

## [v1.0.6]

Add color variable in price card

### Added

- added a color variable for maintainability
  - used the darker parimary color with opacity
- changed hardcoded color to new variable in PriceCard

## [v1.0.5]

Add ability to restrict news according to settings

### Added

- added logics to display only intro and a button if settings say
  - button links to the source url
  - otherwise still render the body content
- added opening of the source of news in a WebView instead of linking external

## [v1.0.4]

Optimize news screen

### Added

- added iterative rendering of content blocks and media contents for news
- added rendering of audio and video as html contents (iframe) in a WebView

## [v1.0.3]

Update detail screens

### Added

- added showing first names of contacts in detail screens if present
- added showing link titles of urls in detail screens if present

## [v1.0.2]

Update performance of lists

### Changed

- refactored the `renderItem` methods of TextList, CardList and CategoryList to their
  own \*Item PureComponent
  - this is given as advice best practice for better performance
  - in local tests the responsivness of the lists increased
- removed `removeClippedSubviews` from lists because it can behave buggy:
  https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/flatlist#removeclippedsubviews
- added conditional rendering of CardList
- if it is a horizontal CardList we do not need a `ListFooterComponent` and the `onEndReached` logic
- on the other hand, if it is not a horizontal CardList we do not need
  `showsHorizontalScrollIndicator` and `horizontal` props

### Fixed

- fixed check for weekday in OpeningTimesCard
  - with casting to boolean we will be more safe on checking for presence of weekday data
  - otherwise an empty string would be tried to render which results in app crash
- fixed warnings for 'Require cycle:' with correcting imports
- fixed Android 9 lag bug with images carousel
  - removed images from app
  - query for images from the main server
  - with this the urls are web urls instead of in-app images which seems to work smoothly

## [v1.0.1]

Small update for tours, points of interest and news

### Added

- added location addition to address in tours and points of interest

### Fixed

- fixed title in news, which accidentally disappeared after refactoring

## [v1.0.0] :rocket: :100:

Finalize the app with new feature and fixes

### Added

- added screen for categories selection to navigate to certain points of interest and tours
  - added CategoryList based on TextList but with sections and an intro text
  - added categories query
  - added option for category filter in tours and pointsOfInterest queries
  - updated query for all tours and points of interest on HomeScreen
  - renamed every "Orte und Touren" to "Touren und Orte" because we
    show them in that order on the category screen
    - there are less tours, and showing the points of interest first would
      fill the whole screen, so one can only reach and see tours on scrolling
  - exchanged `pointsOfInterestAndTours` case on IndexScreen with `categories`
    - we have now real categories data to deal with easier
  - render the count of points of interest or tours in CategoryList behind the category name
  - added a `key` for navigation in CategoryList, because it is still an Index route but we
    want to push it anyway with animation instead of only changing screen content, what
    would happen with same routeName and same implicit key
  - added a condition to not show a bottom divider after last tour because it would
    add an ugly line before the "Orte" section header
- added image carousel on home screen and in detail screen if there are more than one image
- added NewsItem and refactor it out of DetailScreen
- added bottom margin for Buttons for better visual sectioning

### Changed

- improved offline usability
  - use finally promise method to ensure triggering of callback
  - in <MainAppWithApolloProvider /> we setup the apollo client regardless of the network
    connection right now...so if the app is offline, our fetch will fail and the callback is
    never fired
    - this led to a never running app when opening it offline
    - hope this fix makes the app also start up without network connection
- show address addition in event record subtitle and share message instead of city
- wrapped NetworkProvider around the whole app
  - this makes it possible to handle network changes inside of `<MainAppWithApolloProvider />`
- updated horizontal CardList with shortening the titles
  - if more than 60 characters, we trim and add '...'
  - so we always have a maximum of two lines there

### Fixed

- added prefetched data for event records from list screens to details
- fixed strange behaviour with broken layouts on first opening of a detail screen
  - it seems like this was a result of badly used `flex: 1` in different components
  - removed `flex: 1`s
  - merged wrapper
  - deleted superfluous wrapper
- get rid of FlatList inside of ScrollView, which is bad practice
  - removed wrapping ScrollView in IndexScreen
  - removed hacky `scrollEnabled={false}` in TextList
- fixed sizes of images and iframe in HTML renderer
  - thx to https://github.com/archriss/react-native-render-html/issues/86
    and https://github.com/archriss/react-native-render-html/issues/134
  - we need to ignore and remove the given width and heights in the html to let the magic happen
  - added height for iframe in html styles because otherwise it has not the right format

### Removed

- old and unused files and images

## [v0.9.5]

Fix and update share messages + subtitle

### Changed

- updated contents of share messages
  - we cannot use the description for pois and tours anymore, because they are HTML
    and not plain text
- updated subtitles of event records to city location instead of provider name

### Fixed

- fixed query parameter in IndexScreen for share messages
  - needs to be singular for a certain item and not the `query` variable available,
    because that is plural

## [v0.9.4]

Add tours to list of points of interest and create tour detail screens

### Added

- added a new logic in order display tour and point of interest in the same list
- added queries for tours
- added combined query for points of interest and tours to present them both in the same list
- added detail screen for tours with a special tour section
  - render only addresses with kind `start` and `end` in this TourCard
- added query for kind in all addresses queries
- added logic for `open` for openingHours of points of interest
  - need to have that (somehow strange) check for `(open === undefined || open === true)`,
    because we use this component for PointOfInterest and EventRecord but event records
    have no `open` data

### Changed

- updated lists of points of interest and tours to be ordered alphabetically on index screen
- list 10 points of interest and 10 tours randomly shuffled on the home screen
- render only addresses with kind `default` in InfoCard

### Fixed

- fixed rendering of opening times and event dates when there is time, date AND description
  - the layout was broken so now we render the description in an extra row below the time and date

## [v0.9.3]

Show only upcoming events

### Added

- added check for upcoming event based on the `listDate` of a event record
- used `moment` helper for determining, if an event is in the past
- used lodash `filter` to filter data and reject past events on HomeScreen and IndexScreen
  - still render only the next 3 events on the HomeScreen
  - used lodash `take` for it

### Changed

- now we request always all events and filter afterwards
  - this could lead to worse performance than before

## [v0.9.2]

Update to latest server changes

### Added

- added version number to the bottom of the HomeScreen

### Changed

- changed `prices` to `priceInformations` for points of interest
- sort event records on `listDate`
- render `listDate` in event record teasers on index screens

## [v0.9.1]

Update event record detail screens

### Fixed

- using ScrollView instead of ScrollWrapper in EventRecord to get rid
  of strange layout spacings on first render

### Added

- added more detail data to event detail screen
- added different titles for event dates and organizer
- added smaller adjustments to queries

### Changed

- created EventRecord and updated rendering without useEffect
  - we can directly render the data

## [v0.9.0]

Performance optimizations and fixes

### Fixed

- fixed app not loading offline with explicitly handling fetch policies according to online/offline
  network status
- fixed sharing content for points of interest
- more smaller fixes

### Added

- added image caching based on https://github.com/wcandillon/react-native-expo-image-cache
- added a ActivityIndicator logic to CardList and TextList to indicate
  loading/processing while scrolling

### Changed

- updated packages
- refactored code for performance optimizations
- adjusted headerTitleStyle for iOS a bit larger

## [v0.8.6]

Fixes for upcoming release

### Fixed

- fixed bug with missing source url for news item which crashed the app

### Removed

- removed momentFormat for times
  - timeFrom and timeTo are already formatted in the data so we can directly render them
- removed showing `Geschlossen`
  - the data from the server are not ready yet to be used
- removed divider from last opening time

### Changed

- updated title layouts in news and events
  - titles look like the same now all over the app

## [v0.8.2]

Update home screen with different area for service and about

### Added

- added new are for service boxes
  - now we have services and about pages separately

### Fixed

  - screen was pushed instead of navigating to the existing one in the stack because of
    different keys

## [v0.8.1]

Updates on several screens and small bugfixes

### Added

- wrapped every screen with a SafeAreaView
- added missing package for react-native-webview
  - `expo install react-native-webview`

### Changed

- updated InfoCard with contact and category
- changed link in app from share message to source with app name
  - `Quelle: ${app name}`
- updated width for CardList content container
  - not only the image should be 70% of the screen in horizontal appearance but also
    the corresponding text
- renamed `Orte & Routen` to `Orte und Touren`
- updated navigation title for home screen in Drawer

### Fixed

- fixed bug in navigation from drawer inside html screens
  - added key to have unique references for screens, otherwise there was a
    bug navigating from Drawer, that was not rendering a fresh screen
    everytime because the reference did not change
