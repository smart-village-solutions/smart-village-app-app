Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

The development server is the proxy between a native runtime (Expo Go, Dev Client) and a JS Bundler (Metro, Webpack).\n  - To accomplish secure manifest signing (think https/TSL/SSL for web (required for sandboxing AsyncStorage, Permissions, etc.)) we need an authenticated Expo user account. This is the only reason we include the authentication commands `login`, `logout`, `whoami`, `register`. Standard web CLIs don't have authentication commands because they either don't set up https or they use emulation via packages like `devcert`.\n- Orchestrating various native tools like Xcode, `Simulator.app`, Android Studio, ADB, etc. to make native builds as painless as possible. `run:ios`, `run:android` commands.\n- Implementing a versioned `prebuild` command that can reliably work with a project for long periods of time. Prebuild is like a bundler for native code, it generates the `ios`, `android` folders based on the project Expo config (`app.json`).\n  - `npx expo config` is auxiliary to `npx expo prebuild` and used for debugging/introspection.\n- Installing versioned libraries with `npx expo install` this is a minimal utility born out of pure necessity since versioning in React Native is hard to get right.\n\n# Contributing\n\nTo develop the CLI run (defaults to watch mode):\n\n```\nyarn build\n```\n\nWe highly recommend setting up an alias for the Expo CLI so you can try it in projects all around your computer. Open your `.zshrc` or other config file and add:\n\n```\nalias nexpo=\"/path/to/expo/packages/@expo/cli/build/bin/cli\"\n```\n\nThen use it with `nexpo` like `nexpo config`. You can also set up a debug version:\n\n```\nalias expo-inspect=\"node --inspect /path/to/expo/packages/@expo/cli/build/bin/cli\"\n```\n\nThen you can run it and visit `chrome://inspect/#devices` in Chrome, and press \"Open dedicated DevTools for Node\" to get a debugger attached to your process. When debugging the CLI, you'll want to disable workers whenever possible, this will make all code run on the same thread, this is mostly applicable to the `start` command, i.e. `expo-inspect start --max-workers 0`.\n\n## Format\n\n- Be sure to update the [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md) with changes for every PR. You only need to add the message, our GitHub bot will automatically suggest adding your name and PR number to the diff.\n- End `async` functions with `Async` like `runAsync`. This is just how we format functions at Expo.\n- When throwing errors, always opt for `CommandError` instead of `Error` -- this helps with debugging and making the experience feel more coherent.\n- Utilize the unified `Log` module instead of `console.log`.\n- When logging with variables, utilize the following format `Something happened (foo: bar, baz: foz)`.\n  - Avoid other formats like `Something happened: bar, foz` or `Something happened: foo=bar, baz=foz`.\n- Main UI components like command names (`expo start`), arguments (`--port`), and `--help` messages should be modified internally, by the Expo team to ensure the developer experience is unified across Expo tooling. External contributions modifying these core aspects may be rejected.\n- Use the `profile` utility method with the `EXPO_PROFILE=1` environment variable to measure execution time.\n- Avoid globals and singletons as these make testing harder and less predictable. The only global we have (at the time of writing this) is the `isOffline` boolean.\n\n## Environment\n\n- Always be cautious of the transitive size of dependencies. [packagephobia](https://packagephobia.now.sh/) is a great resource for determining if a package is lean. Try to minimize adding dependencies to the CLI.\n- We build the CLI using `taskr` + `swc`, this is partially inspired by Next.js' local CLI.\n- The build pipeline will inline the CLI version as an environment variable that is accessible anywhere in the CLI codebase. You can access it via `process.env.__EXPO_VERSION` instead of reading the local `package.json` at runtime.\n- Unlike the legacy global Expo CLI, this CLI is shipped with `expo` meaning the SDK Version is always present.\n  - Reduce SDK specific tasks since only one SDK should be accounted for in a single version of `@expo/cli`.\n  - The `@expo/config` method `getConfig` does not need the `skipSDKVersionRequirement` in any case since `expo` should always be installed. Ex: `getConfig('...', { skipSDKVersionRequirement: true });` shouldn't be used.\n- Also unlike the global Expo CLI we can assume that node modules are always installed since this CLI should be used via a project's local `node_modules` folder.\n  - This means we can't perform operations that upgrade the `expo` package as these may kill the running process. Features that need this pattern (like `expo upgrade`) should live in standalone global tools.\n\n## Testing\n\nThere are two testing scripts:\n\n- `yarn test`: Controlled unit and integration tests.\n- `yarn test:e2e`: End to end testing for CLI commands. This requires the files to be built with `yarn build`\n\n---\n\n- You can target a specific set of tests with the `--watch` flag. Example: `yarn test --watch config`.\n- We use backticks for `it` blocks. Example <code>it(`works`)</code>.\n- If a pull request is fully self-contained to the `packages/@expo/cli/` folder (i.e. no `yarn.lock` modifications, etc.) then most native CI tests will be skipped, making CI pass faster in PRs.\n\n### Unit Testing Guidelines\n\n- Use `nock` for network requests.\n- No top level `describe` blocks that wrap all the tests in a file.\n- When testing a function, pass the function to the `describe` block instead of a stringified function name:\n  - `describe(foobar, () => {})` instead of `describe('foobar', () => {})`\n- Use virtual `fs` via `memfs` whenever possible.\n- We have a lot of global module [**mocks**](./e2e/setup.ts) already in place, consider them when writing tests.\n- GitHub Copilot can make writing tests a little less tedious.\n\n### E2E Testing Guidelines\n\n- E2E tests should be resilient and reliable, be sure to give them plenty of time for network requests.\n- When testing locally you should attempt to reuse node modules for faster results. In the `npx expo prebuild` and `npx expo start` commands for instance, we utilize a helper method that will default to reusing a project + node_modules when run locally. This can be [toggled off](https://github.com/expo/expo/blob/11a5a4d27b7e1c8e4d6ddf0401397d789d89f52a/packages/%40expo/cli/e2e/__tests__/utils.ts#L174) to bootstrap a fresh project every time.\n- When bootstrapping test projects, utilize the temporary folder `os.tmpdir()` as this folder is automatically cleaned up when the computer restarts.\n\n## Coming from Expo CLI\n\n> TL;DR: `expo-cli` was 'make it work', whereas `@expo/cli` is 'make it right, make it fast'.\n\nThe legacy global `expo-cli` package was deprecated in favor of this versioned `@expo/cli` package for the following reasons:\n\n- `expo-cli` was too big and took way too long to install. This made CI frustrating to set up since you needed to also target global node modules for caching.\n- `expo-cli` worked for almost all versions of the `expo` package, meaning it was getting more complex with every release.\n- `expo-cli` combined service commands (like the legacy `build`, `submit`, `publish`) with project-level commands like `expo start`. We've since divided services into `eas-cli` and project commands into `npx expo` (`@expo/cli`). This structure is more optimal/faster for developers since they can install/update commands when they need them.\n- This CLI utilizes more Node.js standard features like `$EDITOR` instead of the custom `$EXPO_EDITOR` environment variable. Also transitioning away from `$EXPO_DEBUG` and more towards `$DEBUG=expo:*`. These types of changes make Expo CLI play nicer with existing tooling.\n- The DevTools UI has been deprecated to reduce the net install size, minimize complexity, and make room for future debugging UIs (Hermes/v8 Chrome debugger).\n- The `expo start:web` and `expo web` commands have been rolled into `npx expo start` as we now lazily load platforms until the device requests them.\n- Other missing or beta features from `expo-cli` may still be getting migrated over to this new CLI.

    "licenseText": "# expo/devcert\n\nA fork of `devcert` with bundle size optimizations.\n\n# devcert - Development SSL made easy\n\nSo, running a local HTTPS server usually sucks. There's a range of\napproaches, each with their own tradeoff. The common one, using self-signed\ncertificates, means having to ignore scary browser warnings for each project.\n\ndevcert makes the process easy. Want a private key and certificate file to\nuse with your server? Just ask:\n\n```js\nlet ssl = await devcert.certificateFor(\"my-app.test\");\nhttps.createServer(ssl, app).listen(3000);\n```\n\nNow open https://my-app.test:3000 and voila - your page loads with no scary\nwarnings or hoops to jump through.\n\n> Certificates are cached by name, so two calls for\n> `certificateFor('foo')` will return the same key and certificate.\n\n## Options\n\nWhen it installs or upgrades, devcert creates a self-signed certificate\nauthority (CA) which it uses to sign all certificates it creates. It will try\nto register this CA with OS keychains in OSX, Linux, and Windows. However,\nsome HTTP clients (such as Firefox and NodeJS itself) use their own trusted\ncertificate list instead of the operating system's keychain. The `getCaPath`\nand `getCaBuffer` options make the CA available in the `certificateFor()`\nreturn object itself, so that these programs can choose whether to trust it.\n\n### getCaPath\n\nSet this option to `true` and the returned object will inlude a `caPath`\nproperty, set to the file path of the certificate authority file. Use this\npath to add the certificate to local trust stores which accept paths as\narguments, such as NodeJS's builtin environment variable\n`NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`..\n\n### getCaBuffer\n\nSet this option to `true` and the returned object will inlude a `ca`\nproperty, set to the UTF-8-encoded contents of the certificate authority\nfile. Use this path to add the certificate to local trust stores which don't\nuse OS settings, lke the examples mentioned above.\n\n### skipHostsFile\n\nIf you supply a custom domain name (i.e. any domain other than `localhost`)\nwhen requesting a certificate from devcert, it will attempt to modify your\nsystem to redirect requests for that domain to your local machine (rather\nthan to the real domain). It does this by modifying your `/etc/hosts` file.\n\nIf you pass in the `skipHostsFile` option, devcert will skip this step. This\nmeans that if you ask for certificates for `my-app.test` (for example), and\ndon't have some other DNS redirect method in place, that you won't be able to\naccess your app at `https://my-app.test` because your computer wouldn't know\nthat `my-app.test` should resolve your local machine.\n\nKeep in mind that SSL certificates are issued for _domains_, so if you ask\nfor a certificate for `my-app.test`, and don't have any kind of DNS redirect\nin place (`/etc/hosts` or otherwise), trying to hit `localhost` won't work,\neven if the app you intended to serve via `my-app.test` is running on your\nlocal machine (since the SSL certificate won't say `localhost`).\n\n### skipCertutil\n\nThis option will tell devcert to avoid installing `certutil` tooling.\n\n`certutil` is a tooling package used to automated the installation of SSL\ncertificates in certain circumstances; specifically, Firefox (for every OS)\nand Chrome (on Linux only).\n\nNormally, devcert will attempt to install `certutil` if it's need and not\nalready present on your system. If don't want devcert to install this\npackage, pass `skipCertutil: true`.\n\nIf you decide to `skipCertutil`, the initial setup process for devcert\nchanges in these two scenarios:\n\n- **Firefox on all platforms**: Thankully, Firefox makes this easy. There's a\n  point-and-click wizard for importing and trusting a certificate, so if you\n  specify `skipCertutil: true`, devcert will instead automatically open Firefox\n  and kick off this wizard for you. Simply follow the prompts to trust the\n  certificate. **Reminder: you'll only need to do this once per machine**\n\n- **Chrome on Linux**: Unfortunately, it appears that the **only** way to get\n  Chrome to trust an SSL certificate on Linux is via the `certutil` tooling -\n  there is no manual process for it. Thus, if you are using Chrome on Linux, do\n  **not** supply `skipCertuil: true`. If you do, devcert certificates will not\n  be trusted by Chrome.\n\nThe `certutil` tooling is installed in OS-specific ways:\n\n- Mac: `brew install nss`\n- Linux: `apt install libnss3-tools`\n- Windows: N/A (there is no easy, hands-off way to install certutil on Windows,\n  so devcert will simply fallback to the wizard approach for Firefox outlined\n  above)\n\n## How it works\n\nWhen you ask for a development certificate, devcert will first check to see\nif it has run on this machine before. If not, it will create a root\ncertificate authority and add it to your OS and various browser trust stores.\nYou'll likely see password prompts from your OS at this point to authorize\nthe new root CA.\n\nSince your machine now trusts this root CA, it will trust any certificates\nsigned by it. So when you ask for a certificate for a new domain, devcert\nwill use the root CA credentials to generate a certificate specific to the\ndomain you requested, and returns the new certificate to you.\n\nIf you request a domain that has already had certificates generated for it,\ndevcert will simply return the cached certificates.\n\nThis setup ensures that browsers won't show scary warnings about untrusted\ncertificates, since your OS and browsers will now trust devcert's\ncertificates.\n\n## Security Concerns\n\nThere's a reason that your OS prompts you for your root password when devcert\nattempts to install it's root certificate authority. By adding it to your\nmachine's trust stores, your browsers will automatically trust _any_ certificate\ngenerated with it.\n\nThis exposes a potential attack vector on your local machine: if someone else\ncould use the devcert certificate authority to generate certificates, and if\nthey could intercept / manipulate your network traffic, they could theoretically\nimpersonate some websites, and your browser would not show any warnings (because\nit trusts the devcert authority).\n\nTo prevent this, devcert takes steps to ensure that no one can access the\ndevcert certificate authority credentials to generate malicious certificates\nwithout you knowing. The exact approach varies by platform:\n\n- **macOS and Linux**: the certificate authority's credentials are written to files that are only readable by the root user (i.e. `chown 0 ca-cert.crt` and\n  `chmod 600 ca-cert.crt`). When devcert itself needs these, it shells out to\n  `sudo` invocations to read / write the credentials.\n- **Windows**: because of my unfamiliarity with Windows file permissions, I\n  wasn't confident I would be able to correctly set permissions to mimic the setup\n  on macOS and Linux. So instead, devcert will prompt you for a password, and then\n  use that to encrypt the credentials with an AES256 cipher. The password is never\n  written to disk.\n\nTo further protect these credentials, any time they are written to disk, they\nare written to temporary files, and are immediately deleted after they are no longer needed.\n\nAdditionally, the root CA certificate is unique to your machine only: it's\ngenerated on-the-fly when it is first installed. ensuring there are no\ncentral / shared keys to crack across machines.\n\n### Why install a root certificate authority at all?\n\nThe root certificate authority makes it simpler to manage which domains are\nconfigured for SSL by devcert. The alternative is to generate and trust\nself-signed certificates for each domain. The problem is that while devcert\nis able to add a certificate to your machine's trust stores, the tooling to\nremove a certificate doesn't cover every case. So if you ever wanted to\n_untrust_ devcert's certificates, you'd have to manually remove each one from\neach trust store.\n\nBy trusting only a single root CA, devcert is able to guarantee that when you\nwant to _disable_ SSL for a domain, it can do so with no manual intervention\n\n- we just delete the domain-specific certificate files. Since these\n  domain-specific files aren't installed in your trust stores, once they are\n  gone, they are gone.\n\n## Integration\n\ndevcert has been designed from day one to work as low-level library that other\ntools can delegate to. The goal is to make HTTPS development easy for everyone,\nregardless of framework or library choice.\n\nWith that in mind, if you'd like to use devcert in your library/framework/CLI,\ndevcert makes that easy.\n\nIn addition to the options above, devcert exposes a `ui` option. This option\nallows you to control all the points where devcert requries user interaction,\nsubstituting your own prompts and user interface. You can use this to brand\nthe experience with your own tool's name, localize the messages, or integrate\ndevcert into a larger existing workflow.\n\nThe `ui` option should be an object with the following methods:\n\n```ts\n{\n  async getWindowsEncryptionPassword(): Promise<string> {\n    // Invoked when devcert needs the password used to encrypt the root\n    // certificate authority credentials on Windows. May be invoked multiple\n    // times if the user's supplied password is incorrect\n  },\n  async warnChromeOnLinuxWithoutCertutil(): Promise<string> {\n    // Invoked when devcert is run on Linux, detects that Chrome is installed,\n    // and the `skipCertutil` option is `true`. Used to warn the user that\n    // Chrome will not work with `skipCertutil: true` on Linux.\n  },\n  async closeFirefoxBeforeContinuing() {\n    // Invoked when devcert detects that Firefox is running while it is trying\n    // to programmatically install it's certificate authority in the Firefox\n    // trust store. Firefox appears to overwrite changes to the trust store on\n    // exit, so Firefox must be closed before devcert can continue. devcert will\n    // wait for Firefox to exit - this is just to prompt the user that they\n    // need to close the application.\n  },\n  async startFirefoxWizard(certificateHost: string) {\n    // Invoked when devcert detects a Firefox installation and `skipCertutil:\n    // true` was specified. This is invoked right before devcert launches the\n    // Firefox certificate import wizard GUI. Used to give the user a heads up\n    // as to why they are about to see Firefox pop up.\n    //\n    // The certificateHost provided is the URL for the temporary server that\n    // devcert has spun up in order to trigger the wizard(Firefox needs try to\n    // \"download\" the cert to trigger the wizard). This URL will load the page\n    // supplied in the `firefoxWizardPromptPage()` method below.\n    //\n    // Normally, devcert will automatically open this URL, but in case it fails\n    // you may want to print it out to the console with an explanatory message\n    // so the user isn't left hanging wondering what's happening.\n  },\n  async firefoxWizardPromptPage(certificateURL: string): Promise<string> {\n    // When devcert starts the Firefox certificate installation wizard GUI, it\n    // first loads an HTML page in Firefox. The template used for that page is\n    // the return value of this method. The supplied certificateURL is the path\n    // to the actual certificate. The Firefox tab must attempt to load this URL\n    // to trigger the wizard.\n    //\n    // The default implemenation is a simple redirect to that URL. But you could\n    // supply your own branded template here, with a button that says \"Install\n    // certificate\" that is linked to the certificateURL, along with a more in\n    // depth explanation of what is happening for example.\n  }\n  async waitForFirefoxWizard() {\n    // Invoked _after_ the Firefox certificate import wizard is kicked off. This\n    // method should not resolve until the user indicates that the wizard is\n    // complete (unfortunately, we have no way of determining that\n    // programmatically)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nYou can supply any or all of these methods - ones you do not supply will fall\nback to the default implemenation.\n\n## Testing\n\nTesting a tool like devcert can be a pain. I haven't found a good automated\nsolution for cross platform GUI testing (the GUI part is necessary to test\neach browser's handling of devcert certificates, as well as test the Firefox\nwizard flow).\n\nTo make things easier, devcert comes with a series of virtual machine images. Each one is a snapshot taken right before running a test - just launch the machine and hit <Enter>.\n\nYou can also use the snapshotted state of the VMs to roll them back to a\npristine state for another round of testing.\n\n> **Note**: Be aware that the macOS license terms prohibit running it on\n> non-Apple hardware, so you must own a Mac to test that platform. If you don't\n> own a Mac - that's okay, just mention in the PR that you were unable to test\n> on a Mac and we're happy to test it for you.\n\n### Virtual Machine Snapshots\n\n- [macOS](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/devcert-test-snapshots/macOS.pvm.zip)\n- [Windows](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/devcert-test-snapshots/MSEdge+-+Win10.zip)\n- [Ubuntu](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/devcert-test-snapshots/Ubuntu+Linux.zip)\n\n## License\n\nMIT © [Dave Wasmer](http://davewasmer.com)",

[Find your preset here.](./src/presets)** Each preset is accessible in a separate module to limit bundle size.\n\n```js\nimport arabicIndic from '@jsamr/counter-style/presets/arabicIndic';\n\nexpect(arabicIndic.renderMarker(78)).toBe('٧٨. ');\n```\n\n> PRs are welcomed to support other presets. Very easy to implement thanks to [this W3C resource](https://www.w3.org/TR/predefined-counter-styles/).\n\n\n<a name=\"custom-style-renderers\">\n\n### Creating custom style renderers\n\nThe API follows closely the specs for CSS `@counter-style` at rule. The default export ([CounterStyle](./docs/counter-style.counterstyle.md)) is a static object with methods to build [CounterStyleRenderer](./docs/counter-style.counterstylerenderer.md).\n\n#### Example 1: a lower Russian alphabet renderer\n\nIn the\nbelow example, we're using [the alphabetic counter system](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-counter-styles-3/#alphabetic-system) and `alphabeticFromUnicodeRange` builder which allows to specify a contiguous unicode range. For non-contiguous ranges, use the `alphabetic` builder.\n\n```js\nimport CounterStyle from '@jsamr/counter-style';\n\nconst lowerRussian = CounterStyle.alphabeticFromUnicodeRange(\n  0x430, // а\n  28\n).withSuffix(') ');\n\n// Expect comes from jest testing framework.\n// Just a showcase of expected returned values.\nexpect(lowerRussian.renderCounter(1)).toBe('а');\nexpect(lowerRussian.renderMarker(1)).toBe('а) ');\nexpect(lowerRussian.renderCounter(2)).toBe('б');\nexpect(lowerRussian.renderCounter(3)).toBe('в');\nexpect(lowerRussian.renderMarker(4)).toBe('г) ');\nexpect(lowerRussian.renderMarker(5)).toBe('д) ');\nexpect(lowerRussian.renderCounter(29)).toBe('аа');\nexpect(lowerRussian.maxMarkerLenInRange(1, 5)).toBe(3);\nexpect(lowerRussian.maxCounterLenInRange(1, 5)).toBe(1);\n```\nReference: [W3C Ready-made Counter Styles: Cyrillic styles](https://www.w3.org/TR/predefined-counter-styles/#cyrillic-styles).\n\n#### Example 2: a \"Funky\" symbolic renderer\n\nIn the\nbelow example, we're using [the symbolic counter system](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-counter-styles-3/#symbolic-system).\nNote that `withSuffix(null)` removes default suffix.\n\n```js\nimport CounterStyle from '@jsamr/counter-style';\n\n// Default suffix is \". \", as per the specs.\nconst funky = CounterStyle.symbolic('*', '&').withSuffix(null);\n\n// Expect comes from jest testing framework.\n// Just a showcase of expected returned values.\nexpect(funky.renderMarker(1)).toBe('*');\nexpect(funky.renderMarker(2)).toBe('&');\nexpect(funky.renderMarker(3)).toBe('**');\nexpect(funky.renderMarker(4)).toBe('&&');\nexpect(funky.renderMarker(5)).toBe('***');\nexpect(funky.maxMarkerLenInRange(1, 5)).toBe(3);\nexpect(funky.maxCounterLenInRange(1, 5)).toBe(3);\n```\n\nAll renderers can be chained to create variants, such as `withSuffix`,\n`withPaddingLeft`, ... See [available methods in the docs.](./docs/counter-style.counterstylerenderer.md)\n\n### API reference\n\n**The API reference [is available here](./docs/counter-style.md).**\n\n### Caveats\n\n- Instead of a normal space character, a non-breaking space is used for default\n  prefixes. This is because this library primary usage is for React Native. On\n  iOS, `Text` elements get trimmed of normal space characters.\n- In **numeric** and **alphabetic** systems , one UTF-16 code unit per symbol\n  must be used. Otherwise, length computation will be erroneous. If you really\n  need multi code units per symbol however, you can still set a custom length\n  computer via `withMaxLenComputer`.\n- When using padding (`withPadding`) and negative (`withNegative`) symbols, one\n  UTF-16 code unit per symbol must be used. Otherwise, length computation will\n  be erroneous.\n- Never use combining characters. [Grapheme\n  clusters](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-3/#grapheme-cluster) will be\n  considered distinct characters. Beware that is the case for some emojis, see\n  [this SO thread](https://stackoverflow.com/q/54369513/2779871).\n- Don't define incomplete additive systems which have holes in their range\n  coverage. For example, an additive system which has no representation for \"1\"\n  will not translate odd indexes.\n\n### Limitations\n\n- `speakAs` hasn't been implemented yet.\n- [Chinese renderers](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-counter-styles-3/#limited-chinese)\n  haven't been implemented, requiring custom logic. PRs welcomed!\n- Only textual symbols are supported. Images are not.",

This library exports\ndozens of presets as individual modules (see examples below) and also provides\nan easy API to create custom counter styles. [Check the docs\nhere](https://github.com/jsamr/react-native-li/tree/master/packages/counter-style#readme).\n\n[`MarkedList`](docs/react-native-li.markedlist.md) will render every children as a list item (li). If you want to\nrender items in a different container, you should instead use [`MarkedListItem`](docs/react-native-li.markedlistitem.md) in\ncombination with [`useMarkedList`](docs/react-native-li.usemarkedlist.md). The latter takes exactly the same props as `MarkedListItem` + a `length` prop corresponding to the number of list items to render. It returns base props for the `MarkedListItem` component.\n\n[The full API including components props is available here](./docs/react-native-li.md).\n\n### Examples\n\n#### Lower Latin\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { ScrollView, StyleSheet, Text } from 'react-native';\nimport lowerLatin from '@jsamr/counter-style/presets/lowerLatin';\nimport MarkedList from '@jsamr/react-native-li';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <ScrollView style={{ flexGrow: 1 }}>\n      <MarkedList counterRenderer={lowerLatin}>\n        {[...Array(100).keys()].map((index) => (\n          <Text key={index} style={{ flexShrink: 1 }}>\n            The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)\n            develops international standards\n            for the web and HTML, CSS, and more.\n          </Text>\n        ))}\n      </MarkedList>\n    </ScrollView>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary>Show rendered 🖼</summary>\n<img src=\"screenshots/lower-roman-ltr.png\" />\n</details>\n\n#### Disc\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { ScrollView, StyleSheet, Text } from 'react-native';\nimport disc from '@jsamr/counter-style/presets/disc';\nimport MarkedList from '@jsamr/react-native-li';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <ScrollView style={{ flexGrow: 1 }}>\n      <MarkedList counterRenderer={disc}>\n        {[...Array(100).keys()].map((index) => (\n          <Text key={index} style={{ flexShrink: 1 }}>\n            The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)\n            develops international standards\n            for the web and HTML, CSS, and more.\n          </Text>\n        ))}\n      </MarkedList>\n    </ScrollView>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary>Show rendered 🖼</summary>\n<img src=\"screenshots/disc-ltr.png\" />\n</details>\n\n#### Arabic + RTL\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { ScrollView, StyleSheet, Text } from 'react-native';\nimport arabicIndic from '@jsamr/counter-style/presets/arabicIndic';\nimport MarkedList from '@jsamr/react-native-li';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <ScrollView style={{ flexGrow: 1 }}>\n      <MarkedList\n        counterRenderer={arabicIndic}\n        rtlLineReversed\n        rtlMarkerReversed>\n        {[...Array(100).keys()].map((index) => (\n          <Text key={index} style={{ flexShrink: 1 }}>\n            يقوم اتحاد شبكة الويب العالمية\n            (W3C) بتطوير معايير دولية للويب و\n            HTML و CSS وغير ذلك الكثير.\n          </Text>\n        ))}\n      </MarkedList>\n    </ScrollView>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary>Show rendered 🖼</summary>\n<img src=\"screenshots/arabic-indic-rtl.png\" />\n</details>\n\n#### Disc + RTL\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { ScrollView, StyleSheet, Text } from 'react-native';\nimport disc from '@jsamr/counter-style/presets/disc';\nimport MarkedList from '@jsamr/react-native-li';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <ScrollView style={{ flexGrow: 1 }}>\n      <MarkedList counterRenderer={disc} rtlLineReversed rtlMarkerReversed>\n        {[...Array(100).keys()].map((index) => (\n          <Text key={index} style={{ flexShrink: 1 }}>\n            يقوم اتحاد شبكة الويب العالمية\n            (W3C) بتطوير معايير دولية للويب و\n            HTML و CSS وغير ذلك الكثير.\n          </Text>\n        ))}\n      </MarkedList>\n    </ScrollView>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary>Show rendered 🖼</summary>\n<img src=\"screenshots/disc-rtl.png\" />\n</details>\n\n## API Reference\n\n[See autogenerated docs here](./docs/react-native-li.md).\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Marker box width is too wide, how can I change it?\n\nWidth is approximated with the maximum marker string length in range, but letter widths may vary a lot depending on font and scripts. Use `computeMarkerBoxWidth` prop to customize width, or use `markerStyle` to override width.\n\n### What to do when text in list items overflows?\n\nDon't forget to add `flexShrink: 1` to your `Text` element.\n\n### How to extend a preset, such as changing the prefix or suffix?\n\nThat's really stunningly easy:\n\n```js\nimport arabicIndic from '@jsamr/counter-style/presets/arabicIndic';\n\nconst myCustomArabicIndic = arabicIndic.withPrefix('(').withSuffix(')');\n\n// Expect comes from jest testing framework.\n// Just a showcase of expected returned values.\nexpect(myCustomArabicIndic.renderMarker(78)).toBe('(٧٨)');\n```\n\n\n### How easy it is to create a custom counter renderer?\n\nThat's really quite easy. Check [`@jsamr/counter-style` examples section](https://github.com/jsamr/react-native-li/tree/master/packages/counter-style#custom-style-renderers).",

This is\nequivalent to `resizeMode: 'contain'` for images. See example below with\n`scalesPageToFit` enabled (left) and disabled (right):\n\n![](/blob/master/images/scalesPageToFit.jpg)\n\n## Providing headers\n\n```jsx\nimport IframeRenderer, { iframeModel } from '@native-html/iframe-plugin';\nimport RenderHTML from 'react-native-render-html';\nimport WebView from 'react-native-webview';\n\nconst renderers = {\n  iframe: IframeRenderer\n}\n\nconst customHTMLElementModels = {\n  iframe: iframeModel\n}\n\nfunction provideEmbeddedHeaders(uri, tagName) {\n  if (tagName === \"iframe\" && uri.startsWith(\"https://protected-domain.com\")) {\n    // Pass an authorization header to all iframes in protected-domain.com\n    return {\n      Authorization: \"Bearer XXXXXXXX\";\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n// ...\n\n<RenderHTML renderers={renderers}\n      WebView={WebView}\n      source={{ html: '<iframe width=\"400\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://protected-domain.com/user/cart?embedded\"></iframe>' }}\n      customHTMLElementModels={customHTMLElementModels}\n      provideEmbeddedHeaders={provideEmbeddedHeaders}\n/>\n\n```\n\n## Customizing the renderer\n\nYou can customize the renderer logic thanks to `useHtmlIframeProps` hook, `iframeModel` and `HTMLIframe` exports:\n\n```jsx\nimport {\n  useHtmlIframeProps,\n  HTMLIframe,\n  iframeModel\n} from '@native-html/iframe-plugin';\n\nconst IframeRenderer = function IframeRenderer(props) {\n  const iframeProps = useHtmlIframeProps(props);\n  // Do customize the props here; wrap with your own container...\n  return <HTMLIframe {...iframeProps} />;\n};\n\nconst renderers = {\n  iframe: IframeRenderer\n};\n\n// use \"renderers\" prop in your RenderHTML instance\n```\n\n## API Reference\n\nDocumentation for all exports of this library [is available here](docs/iframe-plugin.md).",

Inject `renderers`, `customHTMLElementModels` and `WebView` props to the `HTML` component;\n\n```javascript\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { ScrollView } from 'react-native';\nimport HTML from 'react-native-render-html';\nimport TableRenderer, { tableModel } from '@native-html/table-plugin';\nimport WebView from 'react-native-webview';\n\nconst html = `\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Entry Header 1</th>\n    <th>Entry Header 2</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Entry First Line 1</td>\n    <td>Entry First Line 2</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n`;\n\nconst htmlProps = {\n  WebView,\n  renderers: {\n    table: TableRenderer\n  },\n  renderersProps: {\n    table: {\n      // Put the table config here\n    }\n  },\n  customHTMLElementModels: {\n    table: tableModel\n  }\n};\n\nexport const Example = () => (\n  <ScrollView>\n    <HTML source={{ html }} {...htmlProps} />\n  </ScrollView>\n);\n```\n\n## API Reference\n\n**The complete API reference is available here: [docs/table-plugin.md](https://github.com/native-html/plugins/blob/master/packages/table-plugin/docs/table-plugin.md).**\nMost notably, check [`TableConfig`](https://github.com/native-html/plugins/blob/master/packages/table-plugin/docs/table-plugin.tableconfig.md) to see how you can customize the table behavior.\n\n**Landmark exports**:\n\n- [`TableRenderer(default)`](https://github.com/native-html/plugins/blob/master/packages/table-plugin/docs/table-plugin.tablerenderer.md)\n- [`useHtmlTableProps`](https://github.com/native-html/plugins/blob/master/packages/table-plugin/docs/table-plugin.usehtmltableprops.md)\n\nOther exports:\n\n- [`HTMLTable`](https://github.com/native-html/plugins/blob/master/packages/table-plugin/docs/table-plugin.htmltable.md)\n- [`defaultTableStylesSpecs`](https://github.com/native-html/plugins/blob/master/packages/table-plugin/docs/table-plugin.defaulttablestylesspecs.md)\n- [`cssRulesFromSpecs`](https://github.com/native-html/plugins/blob/master/packages/table-plugin/docs/table-plugin.cssrulesfromspecs.md)\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n<a name=\"errors-when-importing-webview-component\" />\n\n### Errors when importing `WebView` component\n\n> :warning: **Always favor\n> [`react-native-community/react-native-webview`](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-webview)\n> over legacy `WebView` when possible.**\n\nSetting up `WebView` component largely vary on your `react-native` or `expo` version.\nPlease refer to the official documentation and make sure you have selected your RN / Expo SDK version:\n\n- [Expo](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/sdk/webview/);\n- [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/webview).\n\n## FAQ\n\n### How to easily style the table?\n\nUse `TableConfig.tableStyleSpecs`. The options will get merged with defaults,\nso you are not required to pass every field. See\n[documentation](https://github.com/native-html/plugins/blob/master/packages/table-plugin/docs/table-plugin.tablestylespecs.md).\n\n```javascript\nimport TableRenderer {\n  defaultTableStylesSpecs,\n  cssRulesFromSpecs\n} from '@native-html/table-plugin';\n\nconst htmlProps = {\n  renderers: { table: TableRenderer },\n  renderersProps: {\n    table: {\n      tableStyleSpecs: {\n        // my style specs\n      }\n    }\n  }\n};\n```\n\n### How to disable autoheight?\n\nPass `computeContainerHeight` option with a function returning `null`:\n\n```javascript\nimport TableRenderer {\n  defaultTableStylesSpecs,\n  cssRulesFromSpecs\n} from '@native-html/table-plugin';\n\nconst htmlProps = {\n  renderers: { table: TableRenderer },\n  renderersProps: {\n    table: {\n      computeContainerHeight() {\n        return null;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n};\n\n```\n\n<a name=\"extend-styles\" />\n\n### How to extend default or custom styles?\n\n**A**: Use `cssRulesFromSpecs` function and override `cssRules` config.\n\n```javascript\nimport TableRenderer {\n  defaultTableStylesSpecs,\n  cssRulesFromSpecs\n} from '@native-html/table-plugin';\n\nconst cssRules =\n  cssRulesFromSpecs(defaultTableStylesSpecs) +\n  `\na {\n  text-transform: uppercase;\n}\n`;\n\nconst tableConfig = {\n  cssRules\n}\n\nconst htmlProps = {\n  renderers: { table: TableRenderer },\n  renderersProps: {\n    table: {\n      cssRules\n    }\n  }\n};\n\n```\n\n### How to customize the Table component?\n\n**A**: See `useHtmlTableProps` hook. [See custom example](https://github.com/native-html/plugins/blob/master/example/CustomExample.js).\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/native-html/table-plugin/raw/master/images/adaptative.jpeg\" width=\"300\">\n\n### How to load custom fonts?\n\n**A**: Extend styles and add `@font-face` rules.\n\n```javascript\nimport TableRenderer, {\n  defaultTableStylesSpecs,\n  cssRulesFromSpecs\n} from '@native-html/table-plugin';\nimport { Platform } from 'react-native';\n\nfunction getFontAssetURL(fontFileName: string) {\n  return Platform.select({\n    ios: `url(${fontFileName})`,\n    android: `url(file://android_asset/fonts/${fontFileName})`\n  });\n}\n\nconst openSansUnicodeRanges =\n  'U+0000-00FF, U+0131, U+0152-0153, U+02BB-02BC, U+02C6, U+02DA, U+02DC, U+2000-206F, U+2074, U+20AC, U+2122, U+2191, U+2193, U+2212, U+2215, U+FEFF, U+FFFD';\n\nconst openSansRegular = getFontAssetURL('OpenSans-Regular.ttf');\n\nconst cssRules =\n  cssRulesFromSpecs({\n    ...defaultTableStylesSpecs,\n    fontFamily: '\"Open Sans\"' // beware to quote font family name!\n  }) +\n  `\n@font-face {\n  font-family: 'Open Sans';\n  font-style: normal;\n  font-weight: 400;\n  src: ${openSansRegular}, format('ttf');\n  unicode-range: ${openSansUnicodeRanges};\n}\n`;\n\nconst htmlProps = {\n  renderers: { table: TableRenderer },\n  renderersProps: {\n    table: {\n      cssRules\n    }\n  }\n};\n```",

React Native itself uses this Babel preset by default when transforming your app's source code.\n\nIf you wish to use a custom Babel configuration by writing a `babel.config.js` file in your project's root directory, you must specify all the plugins necessary to transform your code. React Native does not apply its default Babel configuration in this case. So, to make your life easier, you can use this preset to get the default configuration and then specify more plugins that run before it.\n\n## Usage\n\nAs mentioned above, you only need to use this preset if you are writing a custom `babel.config.js` file.\n\n### Installation\n\nInstall `@react-native/babel-preset` in your app:\n\nwith `npm`:\n\n```sh\nnpm i @react-native/babel-preset --save-dev\n```\n\nor with `yarn`:\n\n```sh\nyarn add -D @react-native/babel-preset\n```\n\n### Configuring Babel\n\nThen, create a file called `babel.config.js` in your project's root directory. The existence of this `babel.config.js` file will tell React Native to use your custom Babel configuration instead of its own. Then load this preset:\n\n```\n{\n  \"presets\": [\"module:@react-native/babel-preset\"]\n}\n```\n\nYou can further customize your Babel configuration by specifying plugins and other options. See [Babel's `babel.config.js` documentation](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/config-files/) to learn more.\n\n## Help and Support\n\nIf you get stuck configuring Babel, please ask a question on Stack Overflow or find a consultant for help.

This package is preconfigured in all React Native projects.\n\n## Usage\n\nMiddleware can be attached to a dev server (e.g. [Metro](https://facebook.github.io/metro/docs/getting-started)) using the `createDevMiddleware` API.\n\n```js\nimport { createDevMiddleware } from '@react-native/dev-middleware';\n\nfunction myDevServerImpl(args) {\n  ...\n\n  const {middleware, websocketEndpoints} = createDevMiddleware({\n    projectRoot: metroConfig.projectRoot,\n    serverBaseUrl: `http://${args.host}:${args.port}`,\n    logger,\n  });\n\n  await Metro.runServer(metroConfig, {\n    host: args.host,\n    ...,\n    unstable_extraMiddleware: [\n      middleware,\n      // Optionally extend with additional HTTP middleware\n    ],\n    websocketEndpoints: {\n      ...websocketEndpoints,\n      // Optionally extend with additional WebSocket endpoints\n    },\n  });\n}\n```\n\n## Included middleware\n\n`@react-native/dev-middleware` is designed for integrators such as [`@expo/dev-server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@expo/dev-server) and [`@react-native/community-cli-plugin`](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/tree/main/packages/community-cli-plugin). It provides a common default implementation for core React Native dev server responsibilities.\n\nWe intend to keep this to a narrow set of functionality, based around:\n\n- **Debugging** — The [Chrome DevTools protocol (CDP)](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/) endpoints supported by React Native, including the Inspector Proxy, which facilitates connections with multiple devices.\n- **Dev actions** — Endpoints implementing core [Dev Menu](https://reactnative.dev/docs/debugging#accessing-the-dev-menu) actions, e.g. reloading the app, opening the debugger frontend.\n\n### HTTP endpoints\n\n<small>`DevMiddlewareAPI.middleware`</small>\n\nThese are exposed as a [`connect`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/connect) middleware handler, assignable to `Metro.runServer` or other compatible HTTP servers.\n\n#### GET `/json/list`, `/json` ([CDP](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/#endpoints))\n\nReturns the list of available WebSocket targets for all connected React Native app sessions.\n\n#### GET `/json/version` ([CDP](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/#endpoints))\n\nReturns version metadata used by Chrome DevTools.\n\n#### GET `/debugger-frontend`\n\nSubpaths of this endpoint are reserved to serve the JavaScript debugger frontend.\n\n#### POST `/open-debugger`\n\nOpen the JavaScript debugger for a given CDP target (direct Hermes debugging).\n\n<details>\n<summary>Example</summary>\n\n    curl -X POST 'http://localhost:8081/open-debugger?appId=com.meta.RNTester'\n</details>\n\n### WebSocket endpoints\n\n<small>`DevMiddlewareAPI.websocketEndpoints`</small>\n\n#### `/inspector/device`\n\nWebSocket handler for registering device connections.\n\n#### `/inspector/debug`\n\nWebSocket handler that proxies CDP messages to/from the corresponding device.\n\n## Contributing\n\nChanges to this package can be made locally and tested against the `rn-tester` app, per the [Contributing guide](https://reactnative.dev/contributing/overview#contributing-code).

That is, you pass it an async\ncallback function, and it returns a new `http.Agent` instance that will invoke the\ngiven callback function when sending outbound HTTP requests.\n\n#### Some subclasses:\n\nHere's some more interesting uses of `agent-base`.\nSend a pull request to list yours!\n\n * [`http-proxy-agent`][http-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP endpoints\n * [`https-proxy-agent`][https-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS endpoints\n * [`pac-proxy-agent`][pac-proxy-agent]: A PAC file proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS\n * [`socks-proxy-agent`][socks-proxy-agent]: A SOCKS proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nInstall with `npm`:\n\n``` bash\n$ npm install agent-base\n```\n\n\nExample\n-------\n\nHere's a minimal example that creates a new `net.Socket` connection to the server\nfor every HTTP request (i.e. the equivalent of `agent: false` option):\n\n```js\nvar net = require('net');\nvar tls = require('tls');\nvar url = require('url');\nvar http = require('http');\nvar agent = require('agent-base');\n\nvar endpoint = 'http://nodejs.org/api/';\nvar parsed = url.parse(endpoint);\n\n// This is the important part!\nparsed.agent = agent(function (req, opts) {\n  var socket;\n  // `secureEndpoint` is true when using the https module\n  if (opts.secureEndpoint) {\n    socket = tls.connect(opts);\n  } else {\n    socket = net.connect(opts);\n  }\n  return socket;\n});\n\n// Everything else works just like normal...\nhttp.get(parsed, function (res) {\n  console.log('\"response\" event!', res.headers);\n  res.pipe(process.stdout);\n});\n```\n\nReturning a Promise or using an `async` function is also supported:\n\n```js\nagent(async function (req, opts) {\n  await sleep(1000);\n  // etc…\n});\n```\n\nReturn another `http.Agent` instance to \"pass through\" the responsibility\nfor that HTTP request to that agent:\n\n```js\nagent(function (req, opts) {\n  return opts.secureEndpoint ? https.globalAgent : http.globalAgent;\n});\n```\n\n\nAPI\n---\n\n## Agent(Function callback[, Object options]) → [http.Agent][]\n\nCreates a base `http.Agent` that will execute the callback function `callback`\nfor every HTTP request that it is used as the `agent` for. The callback function\nis responsible for creating a `stream.Duplex` instance of some kind that will be\nused as the underlying socket in the HTTP request.\n\nThe `options` object accepts the following properties:\n\n  * `timeout` - Number - Timeout for the `callback()` function in milliseconds. Defaults to Infinity (optional).\n\nThe callback function should have the following signature:\n\n### callback(http.ClientRequest req, Object options, Function cb) → undefined\n\nThe ClientRequest `req` can be accessed to read request headers and\nand the path, etc. The `options` object contains the options passed\nto the `http.request()`/`https.request()` function call, and is formatted\nto be directly passed to `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()`, or however\nelse you want a Socket to be created. Pass the created socket to\nthe callback function `cb` once created, and the HTTP request will\ncontinue to proceed.\n\nIf the `https` module is used to invoke the HTTP request, then the\n`secureEndpoint` property on `options` _will be set to `true`_.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\n[http-proxy-agent]: https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-http-proxy-agent\n[https-proxy-agent]: https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent\n[pac-proxy-agent]: https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-pac-proxy-agent\n[socks-proxy-agent]: https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-socks-proxy-agent\n[http.Agent]: https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_agent",

HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE\n==========================\n\nPython was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting\nMathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands\nas a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's\nprincipal author, although it includes many contributions from others.\n\nIn 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for\nNational Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)\nin Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the\nsoftware.\n\nIn May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to\nBeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same\nyear, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became\nZope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see\nhttps://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization\ncreated specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.\nZope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.\n\nAll Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for\nthe Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python\nreleases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes\nthe various releases.\n\n    Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-\n                    from                                compatible?

All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute\n    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The\n    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with\n    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.\n\n(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,\n    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to\n    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1\n    is \"not incompatible\" with the GPL.\n\nThanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's\ndirection to make these releases possible.\n\n\nB.

    "licenseText": "# babel-preset-expo\n\nThis preset extends the default React Native preset (`@react-native/babel-preset`) and adds support for decorators, tree-shaking web packages, and loading font icons with optional native dependencies if they're installed.\n\nYou can use this preset in any React Native project as a drop-in replacement for `@react-native/babel-preset`. If your project isn't using native font loading or web support then this preset will only add support for decorators with `@babel/plugin-proposal-decorators` - this is mostly used for supporting legacy community libraries.\n\nIf you start your **web** project with `@expo/webpack-config` or `npx expo start` and your project doesn't contain a `babel.config.js` or a `.babelrc` then it will default to using `babel-preset-expo` for loading.\n\nIf you have problems with the code in this repository, please file issues & bug reports\nat https://github.com/expo/expo. Thanks!\n\n## Expo Bundler Spec Compliance\n\nA bundler must follow these requirements if they are to be considered spec compliant for use with a **universal React** (Expo) project.\n\n### Babel Loader\n\nThe babel loading mechanism must include the following properties on its `caller`.\n\n#### platform\n\nA `platform` property denoting the target platform. If the `platform` is not defined, it will default to using `web` when the `bundler` is `webpack` -- this is temporary and will throw an error in the future.\n\n| Value     | Description             |\n| --------- | ----------------------- |\n| `ios`     | Runs on iOS devices     |\n| `android` | Runs on Android devices |\n| `web`     | Runs in web browsers    |\n\n#### bundler\n\nA `bundler` property denoting the name of the bundler that is being used to create the JavaScript bundle.\nIf the `bundler` is not defined, it will default to checking if a `babel-loader` is used, if so then `webpack` will be used, otherwise it will default to `metro`.\n\n| Value     | Description                      |\n| --------- | -------------------------------- |\n| `metro`   | Bundling with [Metro][metro]     |\n| `webpack` | Bundling with [Webpack][webpack] |\n\n[metro]: https://facebook.github.io/metro/\n[webpack]: https://webpack.js.org/\n\n## Options\n\n### `react-compiler`\n\nSettings to pass to `babel-plugin-react-compiler`. Set as `false` to disable the plugin. As of SDK 51, you must also enable `experiments.reactCompiler: true` in the `app.json`.\n\n```js\n[\n  'babel-preset-expo',\n  {\n    'react-compiler': {\n      sources: (filename) => {\n        // Match file names to include in the React Compiler.\n        return filename.includes('src/path/to/dir');\n      },\n    },\n  },\n];\n```\n\n### `minifyTypeofWindow`\n\nSet `minifyTypeofWindow: false` to preserve the `typeof window` check in your code, e.g. `if (typeof window === 'undefined')` -> `if (true)` in servers. This is useful when you're using libraries that mock the window object on native or in the server.\n\n```js\n[\n  'babel-preset-expo',\n  {\n    // If your native app doesn't polyfill `window` then setting this to `false` can reduce bundle size.\n    native: {\n      minifyTypeofWindow: true,\n    },\n  },\n];\n```\n\nDefaults to `false` for server environments and web, `true` for native platforms to support legacy browser polyfills.\n\n### `reanimated`\n\n`boolean`, defaults to `true`. Set `reanimated: false` to disable adding the `react-native-reanimated/plugin` when `react-native-reanimated` is installed.\n\n### [`jsxRuntime`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx#runtime)\n\n`classic | automatic`, defaults to `automatic`\n\n- `automatic` automatically convert JSX to JS without the need to `import React from 'react'` in every file. Be sure to follow the rest of the [setup guide](https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/09/22/introducing-the-new-jsx-transform.html#how-to-upgrade-to-the-new-jsx-transform) after enabling this, otherwise ESLint and other tools will throw warnings.\n- `classic` does not automatically import anything, React must imported into every file that uses JSX syntax.\n\n```js\n[\n  'babel-preset-expo',\n  {\n    jsxRuntime: 'classic',\n  },\n];\n```\n\nThis property is passed down to [`@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx). This flag does nothing when `useTransformReactJSXExperimental` is set to `true` because `@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx` is omitted.\n\n### [`jsxImportSource`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx#importsource)\n\n`string`, defaults to `react`\n\nThis option allows specifying a custom import source for importing functions.\n\n```js\n[\n  'babel-preset-expo',\n  {\n    jsxRuntime: 'automatic',\n    jsxImportSource: 'react',\n  },\n];\n```\n\nThis property is passed down to [`@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx). This options does nothing when `jsxRuntime` is not set to `automatic`.\n\n### [`lazyImports`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-modules-commonjs#lazy)\n\nChanges Babel's compiled `import` statements to be lazily evaluated when their imported bindings are used for the first time.\n\n_Note:_ this option has an effect only when the `disableImportExportTransform` option is set to `false`. On Android and iOS, `disableImportExportTransform` defaults to `false`, and on web it defaults to `true` to allow for tree shaking.\n\nThis can improve the initial load time of your app because evaluating dependencies up front is sometimes entirely un-necessary, particularly when the dependencies have no side effects.\n\nThe value of `lazyImports` has a few possible effects:\n\n- `null` - [@react-native/babel-preset](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/tree/main/packages/react-native-babel-preset) will handle it. (Learn more about it here: https://github.com/facebook/metro/commit/23e3503dde5f914f3e642ef214f508d0a699851d)\n- `false` - No lazy initialization of any imported module.\n- `true` - Lazy-init all imported modules except local imports (e.g., `./foo`), certain Expo packages that have side effects, and the two cases mentioned [here](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-modules-commonjs#lazy).\n- `Array<string>` - [babel-plugin-transform-modules-commonjs](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-modules-commonjs#lazy) will handle it.\n- `(string) => boolean` - [babel-plugin-transform-modules-commonjs](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-modules-commonjs#lazy) will handle it.\n\n  If you choose to do this, you can also access the list of Expo packages that have side effects by using `const lazyImportsBlacklist = require('babel-preset-expo/lazy-imports-blacklist');` which returns a `Set`.\n\n**default:** `null`\n\n```js\n[\n    'babel-preset-expo',\n    {\n        lazyImports: true\n    }\n],\n```\n\n### `disableImportExportTransform`\n\nPass `true` to disable the transform that converts import/export to `module.exports`. Avoid setting this property directly. If you're using Metro, set `experimentalImportSupport: true` instead to ensure the entire pipeline is configured correctly.\n\n```js\n// metro.config.js\n\nconfig.transformer.getTransformOptions = async () => ({\n  transform: {\n    // Setting this to `true` will automatically toggle `disableImportExportTransform` in `babel-preset-expo`.\n    experimentalImportSupport: true,\n  },\n});\n```\n\nIf `undefined` (default), this will be set automatically via `caller.supportsStaticESM` which is set by the bundler.\n\n```js\n[\n    'babel-preset-expo',\n    {\n        disableImportExportTransform: true\n    }\n],\n```\n\n### `unstable_transformProfile`\n\nChanges the engine preset in `@react-native/babel-preset` based on the JavaScript engine that is being targeted. In Expo SDK 50 and greater, this is automatically set based on the [`jsEngine`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/config/app/#jsengine) option in your `app.json`.\n\n### `enableBabelRuntime`\n\nPassed to `@react-native/babel-preset`.\n\n### `disableFlowStripTypesTransform`\n\nPassed to `@react-native/babel-preset`.\n\n## Platform-specific options\n\nAll options can be passed in the platform-specific objects `native` and `web` to provide different settings on different platforms. For example, if you'd like to only apply `disableImportExportTransform` on web, use the following:\n\n```js\n[\n  'babel-preset-expo',\n  {\n    // Default value:\n    disableImportExportTransform: false,\n\n    web: {\n      // Web-specific value:\n      disableImportExportTransform: true,\n    },\n  },\n];\n```\n\nPlatform-specific options have higher priority over top-level options.",

The Badging API works on Windows, and macOS, in Chrome 81 or later. It has also been confirmed to work on Edge 84 or later. Support for Chrome OS is in development and will be available in a future release of Chrome. On Android, the Badging API is not supported. Instead, Android automatically shows a badge on app icon for the installed web app when there is an unread notification, just as for Android apps. Since this API is not available everywhere, `badgin` safely falls back to alternatives.\n\n## via badge\n\nCurrently, the native badge is only displayed if you install the web application to your home screen (view [prerequisites](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/app-install-banners)). The screenshot shows the application in the dock of macOS.\n\n![](https://github.com/jaulz/badgin/raw/master/assets/screenshots/standalone_osx.png)\n\n## via favicon\n\nIf the native badge is not available, the favicon will be used and a small badge will be added.\n\n![](https://github.com/jaulz/badgin/raw/master/assets/screenshots/favicon.png)\n\n## via title\n\nIf the favicon is not available, the badge will be added as a prefix to the title.\n\n![](https://github.com/jaulz/badgin/raw/master/assets/screenshots/title.png)\n\n## Demo\n\nYou can find a demo at https://jaulz.github.io/badgin/ where you can see the different options. If you want to see the native badge, you need to install the app to your home screen (check out the plus icon in the address bar).\n\n## Installation\n\nThe module can be installed by running:\n\n```\nyarn add --save badgin\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nJust use the library as following:\n\n```js\nimport badgin from 'badgin'\n\nbadgin.set(1) // set value\nbadgin.set() // set indicator only\nbadgin.clear()\n```\n\n### Options\n\nThe following options can be used:\n\n```js\n{\n  method: 'Badging' | 'Favicon' | 'Title'\n  favicon: {\n    backgroundColor: string = '#424242'\n    color: string = '#ffffff'\n    indicator: string = '!'\n    radius: number = 3\n    size: number = 7\n    horizontalMargin: number = 0\n    verticalMargin: number = 0\n    horizontalPadding: number = 1\n    verticalPadding: number = 1\n  }\n  title: {\n    indicator: string = '!'\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAnd you can use it like this:\n\n```js\nbadgin.set(1, {\n  favicon: {\n    width: 9,\n    background: '#549A2F',\n  },\n})\n```\n\n## License / Credits\n\nMIT\n\nThis is a refactored fork of the original Tinycon library, Tinycon is released under the MIT license. Tinycon was inspired by [Notificon](https://github.com/makeable/Notificon).",

If that's the case, the DOM doesn't even have to be touched.\n\n###And why is this a separate module?\n\nI'm trying to modularize `CSSselect` and most modules depend on these functions.

Throws an error if the\ninput is invalid.\n\n```js\nvar obj = bser.loadFromBuffer(buf);\n```\n\n### bser.dumpToBuffer\n\nSynchronously encodes a value as BSER.\n\n```js\nvar encoded = bser.dumpToBuffer(['hello']);\nconsole.log(bser.loadFromBuffer(encoded)); // ['hello']\n```\n\n### BunserBuf\n\nThe asynchronous decoder API is implemented in the BunserBuf object.\nYou may incrementally append data to this object and it will emit the\ndecoded values via its `value` event.\n\n```js\nvar bunser = new bser.BunserBuf();\n\nbunser.on('value', function(obj) {\n  console.log(obj);\n});\n```\n\nThen in your socket `data` event:\n\n```js\nbunser.append(buf);\n```\n\n## Example\n\nRead BSER from socket:\n\n```js\nvar bunser = new bser.BunserBuf();\n\nbunser.on('value', function(obj) {\n  console.log('data from socket', obj);\n});\n\nvar socket = net.connect('/socket');\n\nsocket.on('data', function(buf) {\n  bunser.append(buf);\n});\n```\n\nWrite BSER to socket:\n\n```js\nsocket.write(bser.dumpToBuffer(obj));\n```",

The\nfollowing considerations are for informational purposes only, are not\nexhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.\n\n     Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are\n     intended for use by those authorized to give the public\n     permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by\n     copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are\n     irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms\n     and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.\n     Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before\n     applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the\n     material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any\n     material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-\n     licensed material, or material used under an exception or\n     limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:\n\twiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors\n\n     Considerations for the public: By using one of our public\n     licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the\n     licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If\n     the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for\n     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to\n     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our\n     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain\n     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of\n     the licensed material may still be restricted for other\n     reasons, including because others have copyright or other\n     rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,\n     such as asking that all changes be marked or described.\n     Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to\n     respect those requests where reasonable.

To the\nextent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are\ngranted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of\nthese terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in\nconsideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the\nLicensed Material available under these terms and conditions.\n\n\nSection 1 -- Definitions.\n\n  a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar\n     Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material\n     and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,\n     arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring\n     permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the\n     Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed\n     Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,\n     Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is\n     synched in timed relation with a moving image.\n\n  b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright\n     and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in\n     accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n  c.

For purposes of this Public License, the rights\n     specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar\n     Rights.\n\n  d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the\n     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws\n     fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright\n     Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international\n     agreements.\n\n  e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or\n     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights\n     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\n\n  f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,\n     or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public\n     License.\n\n  g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the\n     terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to\n     all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the\n     Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.\n\n  h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights\n     under this Public License.\n\n  i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or\n     process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such\n     as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,\n     dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material\n     available to the public including in ways that members of the\n     public may access the material from a place and at a time\n     individually chosen by them.\n\n  j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright\n     resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of\n     the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,\n     as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially\n     equivalent rights anywhere in the world.\n\n  k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights\n     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.\n\n\nSection 2 -- Scope.\n\n  a. License grant.\n\n       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,\n          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,\n          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to\n          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\n\n            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or\n               in part; and\n\n            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.\n\n       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where\n          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public\n          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with\n          its terms and conditions.\n\n       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section\n          6(a).\n\n       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The\n          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in\n          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,\n          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The\n          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or\n          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications\n          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including\n          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective\n          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,\n          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)\n          (4) never produces Adapted Material.\n\n       5. Downstream recipients.\n\n            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every\n               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\n               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\n               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this\n               Public License.\n\n            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose\n               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or\n               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the\n               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\n               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\n               Material.\n\n       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\n          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\n          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\n          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\n          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\n          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\n  b. Other rights.\n\n       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\n          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\n          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to\n          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to\n          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\n          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\n          Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\n          Public License.\n\n       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\n          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\n          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\n          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\n          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\n          reserves any right to collect such royalties.\n\n\nSection 3 -- License Conditions.\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the\nfollowing conditions.\n\n  a. Attribution.\n\n       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified\n          form), You must:\n\n            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor\n               with the Licensed Material:\n\n                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\n                    Material and any others designated to receive\n                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\n                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\n                    designated);\n\n                ii. a copyright notice;\n\n               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\n                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\n                    warranties;\n\n                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\n                    extent reasonably practicable;\n\n            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\n               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n\n            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\n               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\n               hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\n          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\n          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\n          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\n          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\n          information.\n\n       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\n          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\n          reasonably practicable.\n\n       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's\n          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted\n          Material from complying with this Public License.\n\n\nSection 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\napply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\n  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right\n     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\n     portion of the contents of the database;\n\n  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\n     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\n\n  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\n     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\nreplace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\nRights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\n\nSection 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\n  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\n     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\n     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\n     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\n     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\n     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\n     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\n     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE\n     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\n     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,\n     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR\n     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN\n     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR\n     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR\n     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\n     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\n     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\n     waiver of all liability.\n\n\nSection 6 -- Term and Termination.\n\n  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\n     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\n     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\n     terminate automatically.\n\n  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\n     Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\n          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\n          violation; or\n\n       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\n     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\n     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\n     of this Public License.\n\n  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\n     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\n     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\n     will not terminate this Public License.\n\n  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\n     License.\n\n\nSection 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\n     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n\n  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\n     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\n     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\nSection 8 -- Interpretation.\n\n  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\n     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\n     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\n     be made without permission under this Public License.\n\n  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\n     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\n     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\n     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\n     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\n     conditions.\n\n  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\n     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\n     Licensor.\n\n  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted\n     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities\n     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal\n     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n\n=======================================================================\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public\nlicenses.

Every time you change the props or plugins, you'll need to rebuild (and `prebuild`) the native app. If no extra properties are added, defaults will be used.\n\n- `photosPermission` (_string | false_): Sets the iOS `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription` permission message to the `Info.plist`. Setting `false` will skip adding the permission on iOS and **does not** skip the permission on Android. Defaults to `Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your photos`.\n- `cameraPermission` (_string | false_): Sets the iOS `NSCameraUsageDescription` permission message to the `Info.plist`. Setting `false` will skip adding the permission on iOS and **does not** skip the permission on Android. Defaults to `Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your camera`.\n- `microphonePermission` (_string | false_): Sets the iOS `NSCameraUsageDescription` permission message to the `Info.plist`. Setting `false` will skip adding the permission on iOS and skips adding the `android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO` Android permission. Defaults to `Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your photos`.\n\n### Example\n\n```json\n{\n  \"expo\": {\n    \"plugins\": [\n      [\n        \"expo-image-picker\",\n        {\n          \"photosPermission\": \"custom photos permission\",\n          \"cameraPermission\": \"Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to open the camera\",\n\n          \"//\": \"Disables the microphone permission\",\n          \"microphonePermission\": false\n        }\n      ]\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n# Contributing\n\nContributions are very welcome!

    "licenseText": "# expo-in-app-updates\n\nA lightweight and easy-to-use module for implementing native in-app updates for Android and iOS.\n\nThis module uses the Android native [in-app updates](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/in-app-updates) library on Android and [iTunes Search API](https://performance-partners.apple.com/search-api) on iOS.\n\nOn Android, it will show a native overlay like the screenshots below but on iOS it opens the app in the App Store on a modal to update the app, since iOS does not have any in-app update solution. You may want to show an alert or custom UI on iOS. See the [example](#examples) at the bottom.\n\n<a href=\"https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/in-app-updates#flexible\"><img src=\"https://developer.android.com/static/images/app-bundle/flexible_flow.png\" alt=\"Example flexible updates\" height=\"400\"/></a>\n\n<a href=\"https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/in-app-updates#immediate\"><img src=\"https://developer.android.com/static/images/app-bundle/immediate_flow.png\" alt=\"Example immediate updates\" height=\"400\"/></a>\n\n## Installation\n\n```sh\nnpm install expo-in-app-updates\n```\n\nFor iOS, add your `AppStoreID` (the id in your app store link, e.g <https://apps.apple.com/pl/app/example/id1234567890>) in `infoPlist` in your `app.json` / `app.config.js`.\n\nIf your app is not available in the US, the default lookup might not find it. To fix this, you can set the `AppStoreCountry` to a country code where your app is available (e.g `pl` for Poland) in `infoPlist` in your `app.json` / `app.config.js`.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"expo\": {\n    \"ios\": {\n      \"infoPlist\": {\n        \"AppStoreID\": \"1234567890\",\n        \"AppStoreCountry\": \"pl\" // Optional, only if the iTunes lookup used by this library doesn't find your app\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n> For bare React Native projects, you must ensure that you have [installed and configured the `expo` package](https://docs.expo.dev/bare/installing-expo-modules/) before continuing.\n> Run `npx pod-install` after installing the npm package for iOS.\n\n```sh\nnpx expo run:android | run:ios\n```\n\n## Usages\n\n### Check for updates\n\n```ts\nconst {\n  updateAvailable,\n  flexibleAllowed,\n  immediateAllowed,\n  storeVersion,\n  releaseDate,\n  daysSinceRelease\n} = await ExpoInAppUpdates.checkForUpdate();\n```\n\nChecks if an app update is available. Return a promise that resolves `updateAvailable` and `storeVersion` for Android and iOS, `flexibleAllowed` and `immediateAllowed` for Android.\n\n- `updateAvailable`: If an update is available.\n- `flexibleAllowed`: If able to start a [Flexible Update](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/in-app-updates/kotlin-java#flexible) (Android)\n- `immediateAllowed`: If able to start an [Immediate Update](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/in-app-updates/kotlin-java#immediate) (Android)\n- `storeVersion`: The latest app version published in the App Store / Play Store. On Android, this is the `versionCode` that you defined in `app.json`.\n- `releaseDate`: The release date of the current version of the app (iOS)\n- `daysSinceRelease`: The value of the [clientVersionStalenessDays](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/play/core/appupdate/AppUpdateInfo.html#clientVersionStalenessDays()). If an update is available or in progress, this will be the number of days since the Google Play Store app on the user's device has learnt about an available update. If update is not available, or if staleness information is unavailable, this will be null. (Android)\n\n### Start an in-app update\n\n```ts\nconst isUpdateStarted = await ExpoInAppUpdates.startUpdate();\n```\n\nStarts an in-app update. Return a boolean whether the update was started successfully.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> If you want an [Immediate Update](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/in-app-updates/kotlin-java#immediate) that will cover the app with the update overlay, pass true to this function. By default, it will start a [Flexible Update](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/in-app-updates/kotlin-java#flexible). More details : <https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/in-app-updates#update-flows>\n>\n> ```ts\n> const isUpdateStarted = await ExpoInAppUpdates.startUpdate(true);\n> ```\n\n### Check and start an in-app update\n\n```ts\nconst isUpdateStarted = await ExpoInAppUpdates.checkAndStartUpdate();\n```\n\nChecks if an app update is available and starts the update process if necessary. Return a boolean whether the update was started successfully.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> If you want an [Immediate Update](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/in-app-updates/kotlin-java#immediate) that will cover the app with the update overlay, pass true to this function. By default, it will start a [Flexible Update](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/in-app-updates/kotlin-java#flexible). More details : <https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/in-app-updates#update-flows>\n>\n> ```ts\n> const isUpdateStarted = await ExpoInAppUpdates.checkAndStartUpdate(true);\n> ```\n\n> [!TIP]\n> You may want to check for updates and show an alert or custom UI on iOS. Since iOS does not have any in-app update solution, it just opens the app in the App Store on a modal to update the app. See the [example](#examples) below.\n\n### Examples\n\nThis example will ask the user for update the app if update available on every app startup until the user update the app.\n\n```tsx\nimport { useEffect } from \"react\";\nimport { Alert, Platform, Text, View } from \"react-native\";\n\nimport * as ExpoInAppUpdates from \"expo-in-app-updates\";\n\nconst useInAppUpdates = () => {\n  useEffect(() => {\n    if (__DEV__ || Platform.OS === \"web\") return;\n\n    if (Platform.OS === \"android\") {\n      ExpoInAppUpdates.checkAndStartUpdate(\n        // If you want an immediate update that will cover the app with the update overlay, set it to true.\n        // More details : https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/in-app-updates#update-flows\n        false\n      );\n    } else {\n      ExpoInAppUpdates.checkForUpdate().then(({ updateAvailable }) => {\n        if (!updateAvailable) return;\n\n        Alert.alert(\n          \"Update available\",\n          \"A new version of the app is available with many improvements and bug fixes.

First publish your app to App Store at least once. Then make sure you have set the correct `AppStoreID` in your `app.json` / `app.config.js`.\n2. Create a Development/Production/TestFlight build with a lower version number than your App Store version\n3. Install the build on your device\n4. Run the app and the update check should detect the newer App Store version\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> The iTunes Search API used for version checking may have some delay in reflecting the latest App Store version. It's recommended to wait a few minutes after publishing a new version before testing.\n\n---\n\n## Changelog\n\nSee [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for a list of changes in each release.",

This native code has to be linked into the project and, in some cases, configured further. These actions require some modifications to the native project files. One of the steps that has to be done with the native configuration is to enable the autolinking mechanism that takes care of including any supported module's native code into the project. The following configuration is required:\n\n### iOS\n\n> Caution! After you have made the following changes you will need to run `pod install` again.\n\n```ruby\n# Podfile\n\nrequire File.join(File.dirname(`node --print \"require.resolve('react-native/package.json')\"`), \"scripts/react_native_pods\")\nrequire File.join(File.dirname(`node --print \"require.resolve('expo-modules-core/package.json')\"`), \"cocoapods.rb\")\nrequire File.join(File.dirname(`node --print \"require.resolve('expo-modules-core/package.json')\"`), \"scripts/autolinking\")\n\n#  ...\n\ntarget \"TargetName\" do\n  use_unimodules!\n  config = use_native_modules!\n  use_react_native!(:path => config[\"reactNativePath\"])\n\n  # ...\nend\n```\n\n### Android\n\n```groovy\n// app/build.gradle\n\napply from: new File([\"node\", \"--print\", \"require.resolve('expo-modules-core/package.json')\"].execute(null, rootDir).text.trim(), \"../gradle.groovy\")\napply from: new File([\"node\", \"--print\", \"require.resolve('react-native/package.json')\"].execute(null, rootDir).text.trim(), \"../react.gradle\")\napply from: new File([\"node\", \"--print\", \"require.resolve('expo-updates/package.json')\"].execute(null, rootDir).text.trim(), \"../scripts/create-manifest-android.gradle\")\n\n// ...\n\napply from: new File([\"node\", \"--print\", \"require.resolve('@react-native-community/cli-platform-android/package.json')\"].execute(null, rootDir).text.trim(), \"../native_modules.gradle\");\napplyNativeModulesAppBuildGradle(project)\n```\n\n```groovy\n// settings.gradle\n\napply from: new File([\"node\", \"--print\", \"require.resolve('expo-modules-core/package.json')\"].execute(null, rootDir).text.trim(), \"../gradle.groovy\");\nincludeUnimodulesProjects()\n\napply from: new File([\"node\", \"--print\", \"require.resolve('@react-native-community/cli-platform-android/package.json')\"].execute(null, rootDir).text.trim(), \"../native_modules.gradle\");\napplyNativeModulesSettingsGradle(settings)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe scripts that are referenced in Gradle and Cocoapods are usually found the related package inside the project's `node_modules` directory. In the case of monorepos (such as Yarn workspaces) the project directory may not contain `node_modules` at all; instead, the modules are likely to be located at the root of the repository. In order to ensure that both cases are supported, we take advantage of the Node dependency resolution strategy. We invoke a subprocess that spawns the simple JavaScript snippet that tries to locate the desired npm package containing the script we need.\n\n- On iOS, we use [`` ` ` `` (backtick)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3159945/running-command-line-commands-within-ruby-script) ([alternative reference](https://ruby-doc.org/core-3.0.2/Kernel.html#method-i-60)).\n- On Android, we use [String[]#execute](<http://docs.groovy-lang.org/latest/html/groovy-jdk/java/lang/String[].html#execute()>) to obtain the results from the subprocess' stdout.\n\nThe Node process that is spawned runs [`require.resolve`](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v14.x/docs/api/modules.html#modules_require_resolve_request_options) to obtain the path to a module's `package.json`(if you look for the module location using solely module name, you'll be given the path to the file pointed by the `main` attribute from the `package.json` and we need to know the location of the module's root directory). We then assemble the path to the desired script and execute it.\n\nYou can read more about the scripts and libraries used in the examples above in their official READMEs.\n\n# Contributing\n\nContributions are very welcome!

For more information on how to do it, see [this guide](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/using-firebase/#install-and-initialize-react-native-firebase).\n\nThis module requires permission to subscribe to device boot. It's used to setup the scheduled notifications right after the device (re)starts. The `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED` permission is added automatically.\n\n**Note:** Starting from Android 12 (API level 31), to schedule the notification that triggers at the exact time, you need to add `<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM\"/>` to **AndroidManifest.xml**. You can read more about the exact alarm permission [here](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/behavior-changes-12#exact-alarm-permission).\n\n<details><summary><strong>Expand to view how the notification icon and the default color can be customized in a plain React Native app</strong></summary> <p>\n\n- **To customize the icon**:\n\n  You can customize two icons: the default and the large one. See [the Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/notifiers/notifications#Templates) for more details. The steps for them are very similar. The only difference is the tag in the second step.\n\n  1. You will need to ensure that the icon is properly set up and added the project. To read more on how to create a notification icon and add it to the project check out the [“Create notification icon” section](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/image-asset-studio#create-notification) at the official Android guide. Remember the name you use for the icon asset, you will need it later!\n  2. Then head over to `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add a `<meta-data>` tag of `android:name=\"expo.modules.notifications.default_notification_icon\"` (or `android:name=\"expo.modules.notifications.large_notification_icon\"` if you are changing the large icon) inside the `<application>` node referencing the custom icon with `@drawable/<notification_icon_name_you_used_in_step_1>`, like [here](https://github.com/expo/expo/blob/335e67a1a3a91598c02061f3318a881541d0d57a/apps/bare-expo/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml#L44-L46).\n  3. In the end your `AndroidManifest.xml` should look more or less like this:\n\n  ```xml\n  <manifest xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\" ...>\n    ...\n    <application ...>\n      ...\n      <meta-data\n        android:name=\"expo.modules.notifications.default_notification_icon\"\n        android:resource=\"@drawable/ic_stat_notifications\" /> <!-- @drawable/<insert_notification_icon_name> -->\n      ...\n    </application>\n  </manifest>\n  ```\n\n- **To customize the default color of the notification**:\n  1. you will need a color resource added to the native project's resources. Some information on how to do this can be found in [the official Android guide](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/more-resources#Color). The most simple and fail-safe instructions would be to:\n     1. ensure that there is a file under `android/app/src/main/res/values/colors.xml` (if there is none, create it)\n     2. ensure that it's a valid resources XML file (it should start with a `<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>` declaration and have a root node of `<resources>`)\n     3. inside the `<resources>` node add a `<color>` node with an arbitrary name (like `notification_icon_color`) containing the color in HEX format inside, like [here](https://github.com/expo/expo/blob/335e67a1a3a91598c02061f3318a881541d0d57a/apps/bare-expo/android/app/src/main/res/values/colors.xml#L3).\n     4. in the end your `colors.xml` should look more or less like this:\n        ```java\n        <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n        <resources>\n          <color name=\"notification_icon_color\">#4630EB</color>\n        </resources>\n        ```\n  2. now, when the color is added to the project, we need to configure `expo-notifications` to use it when it displays a notification — head over to `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add a `<meta-data>` tag of `android:name=\"expo.modules.notifications.default_notification_color\"` inside the `<application>` node referencing the custom icon with `@color/<notification_icon_color_name>`, like [here](https://github.com/expo/expo/blob/335e67a1a3a91598c02061f3318a881541d0d57a/apps/bare-expo/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml#L47-L49).\n  3. In the end your `AndroidManifest.xml` should look more or less like this:\n  ```xml\n  <manifest xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\" ...>\n    ...\n    <application ...>\n      ...\n      <meta-data\n        android:name=\"expo.modules.notifications.default_notification_color\"\n        android:resource=\"@color/notification_icon_color\" /> <!-- @color/<insert_notification_icon_color_name> -->\n      ...\n    </application>\n  </manifest>\n  ```\n- An `AndroidManifest.xml` with both color (of name `notification_icon_color`) and an icon (of name `ic_stat_notifications`) name would look like this:\n  ```xml\n  <manifest xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\" ...>\n    <application ...>\n      ...\n      <meta-data\n        android:name=\"expo.modules.notifications.default_notification_icon\"\n        android:resource=\"@drawable/ic_stat_notifications\" />\n      <meta-data\n        android:name=\"expo.modules.notifications.default_notification_color\"\n        android:resource=\"@color/notification_icon_color\" />\n      ...\n    </application>\n  </manifest>\n  ```\n\n</p>\n</details>\n\n### Config plugin setup (optional)\n\nIf you're using EAS Build, you can set your Android notification icon and color tint, add custom push notification sounds, and set your iOS notification environment using the expo-notifications config plugin ([what's a config plugin?](https://docs.expo.dev/config-plugins/introduction)). To setup, just add the config plugin to the plugins array of your `app.json` or `app.config.js` as shown below, then rebuild the app.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"expo\": {\n    ...\n    \"plugins\": [\n      [\n        \"expo-notifications\",\n        {\n          \"icon\": \"./local/path/to/myNotificationIcon.png\",\n          \"color\": \"#ffffff\",\n          \"sounds\": [\"./local/path/to/mySound.wav\", \"./local/path/to/myOtherSound.wav\"],\n          \"mode\": \"production\"\n        }\n      ]\n    ],\n  }\n}\n```\n\n<details><summary><strong>Expand to view property descriptions and default values</strong></summary> <p>\n\n- **icon**: Android only. Local path to an image to use as the icon for push notifications. 96x96 all-white png with transparency.\n- **color**: Android only. Tint color for the push notification image when it appears in the notification tray. Default: \"#ffffff\".\n- **sounds**: Array of local paths to sound files (.wav recommended) that can be used as custom notification sounds.\n- **mode**: iOS only. Environment of the app: either 'development' or 'production'. Default: 'development'.\n\n</p>\n</details>\n\n### Add your project's credentials to Expo server (optional)\n\nIf you would like to send notifications with Expo servers, the servers will need to have a way to authenticate with APNS/FCM that they are authorized to send notifications on your behalf. To do this:\n\n- for Firebase Cloud Messaging, check out this guide: _[Uploading Server Credentials](https://docs.expo.dev/push-notifications/using-fcm/#uploading-server-credentials)_,\n- for APNS:\n  - run `expo credentials:manager` in the root of your application,\n  - if you've already uploaded a Push Notifications Key in another project and would like to reuse it in the current project, select _Use existing Push Notifications Key in current project_ (you may need to set `slug` and `ios.bundleIdentifier` fields in `app.json` so that the server knows to which `experienceId` and `bundleIdentifier` the key should be attributed),\n  - if you've never uploaded a Push Notifications Key or would like to add a new one\n    - select _Add new Push Notifications Key_\n    - if you'd like to let Expo handle the process, select _Let Expo handle the process_\n    - if you can't let Expo handle the process or you want to upload your own key, select _I want to upload my own file_\n      - provide a path to the P8 file you have downloaded from [developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com/) website.\n\n# Common gotchas / known issues\n\n### Fetching a push token takes a long time on iOS\n\n`getDevicePushTokenAsync` and `getExpoPushTokenAsync` can sometimes take a long time to resolve on iOS. This is outside of `expo-notifications`'s control, as stated in Apple's [“Troubleshooting Push Notifications” technical note](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/tn2265/_index.html):\n\n> This is not necessarily an error condition. The system may not have Internet connectivity at all because it is out of range of any cell towers or Wi-Fi access points, or it may be in airplane mode. Instead of treating this as an error, your app should continue normally, disabling only that functionality that relies on push notifications.\n\nAs mentioned, the most common reasons for this this are either an invalid Internet connection (fetching a push token requires an Internet connection to register the device with the service provider) or an invalid configuration of your App ID or Provisioning Profile.\n\nHere are a few ways people claim to have solved this problem, maybe one of these will help you solve it, too!\n\n<details><summary><strong>Read the Apple's <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/tn2265/_index.html\">Technical Note on troubleshooting push notifications</a></strong></summary> <p>\n\nGo read the Apple's [Technical Note on troubleshooting push notifications](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/tn2265/_index.html)! This the single most reliable source of information on this problem. To help you grasp what they're suggesting:\n\n- Make sure the device has a reliable connection to the Internet (try turning off Wi-Fi or switching to another network, and disabling firewall block on port 5223, as suggested in [this SO answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/34332047/1123156)).\n- Make sure your app configuration is set properly for registering for push notifications (for bare workflow check out [this guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/AddingCapabilities/AddingCapabilities.html), for managed workflow this is done automatically for you by `expo-cli`) as also suggested by [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/10791240/1123156).\n- If you're in bare workflow you may want to try to debug this even further by logging persistent connection debug information as outlined by [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/8036052/1123156).\n\n</p>\n</details>\n\n<details><summary><strong>Try again in a little while</strong></summary> <p>\n\n- APNS servers near the device may be down as indicated by [this forum thread](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/52224). Take a walk and try again later!\n- Try again in a few days time as suggested by [this GitHub comment](https://github.com/expo/expo/issues/10369#issuecomment-717872956).\n\n</p>\n</details>\n\n<details><summary><strong>Disable network sharing on your device</strong></summary> <p>\n\nYou may need to disable network sharing as this may impact the registration as suggested by [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/59156989/1123156).\n\n</p>\n</details>\n\n<details><summary><strong>Restart your device</strong></summary> <p>\n\nIf you just changed the APNS servers where the app should be registering (by installing a TestFlight build over an Xcode build on the same device) you may need to restart your device as suggested by [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/59864028/1123156).\n\n</p>\n</details>\n\n<details><summary><strong>Setup your device with a SIM card</strong></summary> <p>\n\nIf the device you're experiencing this on hasn't been setup with a SIM card it looks like configuring it may help mitigate this bug as suggested by [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/19432504/1123156).\n\n</p>\n</details>\n\n### Setting custom notification sounds\n\nCustom notification sounds are only supported when using [EAS Build](https://docs.expo.dev/build/introduction/), or in the bare workflow.\n\nTo add custom push notification sounds to your app, add the `expo-notifications` plugin to your `app.json` file:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"expo\": {\n    \"plugins\": [\n      [\n        \"expo-notifications\",\n        {\n          \"sounds\": [\"local/path/to/mySoundFile.wav\"]\n        }\n      ]\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAfter building your app, the array of files will be available for use in both [`NotificationContentInput`](#notificationcontentinput) and [`NotificationChannelInput`](#notificationchannelinput). You _only_ need to provide the base filename- here's an example using the config above:\n\n```ts\nawait Notifications.setNotificationChannelAsync('new-emails', {\n  name: 'E-mail notifications',\n  sound: 'mySoundFile.wav', // Provide ONLY the base filename\n});\n\nawait Notifications.scheduleNotificationAsync({\n  content: {\n    title: \"You've got mail! 📬\",\n    sound: 'mySoundFile.wav', // Provide ONLY the base filename\n  },\n  trigger: {\n    seconds: 2,\n    channelId: 'new-emails',\n  },\n});\n```\n\nYou can also manually add notification files to your Android and iOS projects if you prefer:\n\n<details><summary><strong>Manually adding notification sounds on Android</strong></summary> <p>\n\nOn Androids 8.0+, playing a custom sound for a notification requires more than setting the `sound` property on the `NotificationContentInput`. You will _also_ need to configure the `NotificationChannel` with the appropriate `sound`, and use it when sending/scheduling the notification.\n\nFor the example below to work, you would place your `email-sound.wav` file in `android/app/src/main/res/raw/`.\n\n```ts\n// Prepare the notification channel\nawait Notifications.setNotificationChannelAsync('new-emails', {\n  name: 'E-mail notifications',\n  importance: Notifications.AndroidImportance.HIGH,\n  sound: 'email-sound.wav', // <- for Android 8.0+, see channelId property below\n});\n\n// Eg. schedule the notification\nawait Notifications.scheduleNotificationAsync({\n  content: {\n    title: \"You've got mail! 📬\",\n    body: 'Open the notification to read them all',\n    sound: 'email-sound.wav', // <- for Android below 8.0\n  },\n  trigger: {\n    seconds: 2,\n    channelId: 'new-emails', // <- for Android 8.0+, see definition above\n  },\n});\n```\n\n</p>\n</details>\n\n<details><summary><strong>Manually adding notification sounds on iOS</strong></summary> <p>\n\nOn iOS, all that's needed is to place your sound file in your Xcode project, and then specify the sound file in your `NotificationContentInput`, like this:\n\n```ts\nawait Notifications.scheduleNotificationAsync({\n  content: {\n    title: \"You've got mail! 📬\",\n    body: 'Open the notification to read them all',\n    sound: 'notification.wav',\n  },\n  trigger: {\n    // ...\n  },\n});\n```\n\n</p>\n</details>\n\n# Contributing\n\nContributions are very welcome!

In the managed workflow, just set your [`notification.icon`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/config/app/#notification) and [`notification.color`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/config/app/#notification) keys in `app.json`, and rebuild your app! In the bare workflow, you'll need to follow [these instructions](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/main/packages/expo-notifications#configure-for-android).\n\nFor your notification icon, make sure you follow [Google's design guidelines](https://material.io/design/iconography/product-icons.html#design-principles) (the icon must be all white with a transparent background) or else it may not be displayed as intended.\n\nIn both the managed and bare workflow, you can also set a custom notification color _per-notification_ directly in your [`NotificationContentInput`](#notificationcontentinput) under the `color` attribute.\n\n## Android push notification payload specification\n\nWhen sending a push notification, put an object conforming to the following type as `data` of the notification:\n\n```ts\nexport interface FirebaseData {\n  title?: string;\n  message?: string;\n  subtitle?: string;\n  sound?: boolean | string;\n  vibrate?: boolean | number[];\n  priority?: AndroidNotificationPriority;\n  badge?: number;\n}\n```\n\n## Fetching tokens for push notifications\n\n### `getExpoPushTokenAsync(options: ExpoTokenOptions): ExpoPushToken`\n\nReturns an Expo token that can be used to send a push notification to this device using Expo push notifications service. [Read more in the Push Notifications guide](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/push-notifications/).\n\n> **Note:** For Expo's backend to be able to send notifications to your app, you will need to provide it with push notification keys. This can be done using `expo-cli` (`expo credentials:manager`). [Read more in the “Upload notifications credentials” guide](https://docs.expo.dev/push-notifications/push-notifications-setup/#credentials).\n\n> **Note:** Especially on iOS, `Promise`s returned by this method may take longer periods of time to fulfill. For more information see [Fetching a push token takes a long time on iOS](#fetching-a-push-token-takes-a-long-time-on-ios).\n\n#### Arguments\n\nThis function accepts an optional object allowing you to pass in configuration, consisting of fields (all are optional, but some may have to be defined if configuration cannot be inferred):\n\n- **experienceId (_string_)** -- The ID of the experience to which the token should be attributed. Defaults to [`Constants.manifest.id`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/constants/#constantsmanifest) exposed by `expo-constants`. In the bare workflow, you must provide a value which takes the shape `@username/projectSlug`, where `username` is the Expo account that the project is associated with, and `projectSlug` is your [`slug` from `app.json`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/config/app/#slug).\n- **devicePushToken ([_DevicePushToken_](#devicepushtoken))** -- The device push token with which to register at the backend. Defaults to a token fetched with [`getDevicePushTokenAsync()`](#getdevicepushtokenasync-devicepushtoken).\n- **applicationId (_string_)** -- The ID of the application to which the token should be attributed. Defaults to [`Application.applicationId`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/application/#applicationapplicationid) exposed by `expo-application`.\n- **development (_boolean_)** -- Makes sense only on iOS, where there are two push notification services: sandbox and production. This defines whether the push token is supposed to be used with the sandbox platform notification service. Defaults to [`Application.getIosPushNotificationServiceEnvironmentAsync()`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/application/#applicationgetiospushnotificationserviceenvironmentasync) exposed by `expo-application` or `false`. Most probably you won't need to customize that. You may want to customize that if you don't want to install `expo-application` and still use the sandbox APNS.\n\n#### Returns\n\nReturns a `Promise` that resolves to an object with the following fields:\n\n- **type (_string_)** -- Always `expo`.\n- **data (_string_)** -- The push token as a string.\n\n#### Examples\n\n##### Fetching the Expo push token and uploading it to a server\n\n```ts\nimport Constants from 'expo-constants';\nimport * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';\n\nexport async function registerForPushNotificationsAsync(userId: string) {\n  let experienceId = undefined;\n  if (!Constants.manifest) {\n    // Absence of the manifest means we're in bare workflow\n    experienceId = '@username/example';\n  }\n  const expoPushToken = await Notifications.getExpoPushTokenAsync({\n    experienceId,\n  });\n  await fetch('https://example.com/', {\n    method: 'POST',\n    headers: {\n      'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n    },\n    body: JSON.stringify({\n      userId,\n      expoPushToken,\n    }),\n  });\n}\n```\n\n### `getDevicePushTokenAsync(): DevicePushToken`\n\nReturns a native APNS, FCM token or a [`PushSubscription` data](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PushSubscription) that can be used with another push notification service.\n\n> **Note:** Especially on iOS, `Promise`s returned by this method may take longer periods of time to fulfill. For more information see [Fetching a push token takes a long time on iOS](#fetching-a-push-token-takes-a-long-time-on-ios) section of the documentation.\n\n#### Returns\n\nA `Promise` that resolves to an object with the following fields:\n\n- **type (_string_)** -- Either `ios`, `android` or `web`.\n- **data (_string_ or _object_)** -- Either the push token as a string (for `type == \"ios\" | \"android\"`) or an object conforming to the type below (for `type == \"web\"`):\n  ```ts\n  {\n    endpoint: string;\n    keys: {\n      p256dh: string;\n      auth: string;\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n### `addPushTokenListener(listener: PushTokenListener): Subscription`\n\nIn rare situations a push token may be changed by the push notification service while the app is running. When a token is rolled, the old one becomes invalid and sending notifications to it will fail. A push token listener will let you handle this situation gracefully by registering the new token with your backend right away.\n\n#### Arguments\n\nA single and required argument is a function accepting a push token as an argument. It will be called whenever the push token changes.\n\n#### Returns\n\nA [`Subscription`](#subscription) object representing the subscription of the provided listener.\n\n#### Examples\n\nRegistering a push token listener using a React hook\n\n```tsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';\n\nimport { registerDevicePushTokenAsync } from '../api';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  React.useEffect(() => {\n    const subscription = Notifications.addPushTokenListener(registerDevicePushTokenAsync);\n    return () => subscription.remove();\n  }, []);\n\n  return (\n    // Your app content\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### `removePushTokenSubscription(subscription: Subscription): void`\n\nRemoves a push token subscription returned by a `addPushTokenListener` call.\n\n#### Arguments\n\nA single and required argument is a subscription returned by `addPushTokenListener`.\n\n## Listening to notification events\n\nNotification events include incoming notifications, interactions your users perform with notifications (this can be tapping on a notification, or interacting with it via [notification categories](#manage-notification-categories-interactive-notifications)), and rare occasions when your notifications may be dropped.\n\nA few different listeners are exposed, so we've provided a chart below which will hopefully help you understand when you can expect each one to be triggered:\n\n| User interacted with notification? | App state  | Listener(s) triggered                                                   |\n| :--------------------------------- | :--------: | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| false                              | Foreground | `NotificationReceivedListener`                                          |\n| false                              | Background | `BackgroundNotificationTask`                                            |\n| false                              |   Killed   | none                                                                    |\n| true                               | Foreground | `NotificationReceivedListener` & `NotificationResponseReceivedListener` |\n| true                               | Background | `NotificationResponseReceivedListener`                                  |\n| true                               |   Killed   | `NotificationResponseReceivedListener`                                  |\n\n> In the chart above, whenever `NotificationResponseReceivedListener` is triggered, the same would apply to the `useLastNotificationResponse` hook.\n\n### `useLastNotificationResponse(): undefined | NotificationResponse | null`\n\nA React hook always returning the notification response that was received most recently (a notification response designates an interaction with a notification, such as tapping on it).\n\n> If you don't want to use a hook, you can use `Notifications.getLastNotificationResponseAsync()` instead.\n\n#### Returns\n\nThe hook may return one of these three types/values:\n\n- `undefined` -- until we're sure of what to return\n- `null` -- if no notification response has been received yet\n- a [`NotificationResponse`](#notificationresponse) object -- if a notification response was received\n\n#### Examples\n\nResponding to a notification tap by opening a URL that could be put into the notification's `data` (opening the URL is your responsibility and is not a part of the `expo-notifications` API):\n\n```ts\nimport * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';\nimport { Linking } from 'react-native';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const lastNotificationResponse = Notifications.useLastNotificationResponse();\n  React.useEffect(() => {\n    if (\n      lastNotificationResponse &&\n      lastNotificationResponse.notification.request.content.data.url &&\n      lastNotificationResponse.actionIdentifier === Notifications.DEFAULT_ACTION_IDENTIFIER\n    ) {\n      Linking.openURL(lastNotificationResponse.notification.request.content.data.url);\n    }\n  }, [lastNotificationResponse]);\n\n  return (\n    /*\n     * your app\n     */\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### `addNotificationReceivedListener(listener: (event: Notification) => void): void`\n\nListeners registered by this method will be called whenever a notification is received while the app is running.\n\n#### Arguments\n\nA single and required argument is a function accepting a notification ([`Notification`](#notification)) as an argument.\n\n#### Returns\n\nA [`Subscription`](#subscription) object representing the subscription of the provided listener.\n\n#### Examples\n\nRegistering a notification listener using a React hook\n\n```tsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  React.useEffect(() => {\n    const subscription = Notifications.addNotificationReceivedListener(notification => {\n      console.log(notification);\n    });\n    return () => subscription.remove();\n  }, []);\n\n  return (\n    // Your app content\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### `addNotificationsDroppedListener(listener: () => void): void`\n\nListeners registered by this method will be called whenever some notifications have been dropped by the server. Applicable only to Firebase Cloud Messaging which we use as notifications service on Android. It corresponds to `onDeletedMessages()` callback. [More information can be found in Firebase docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/android/receive#override-ondeletedmessages).\n\n#### Arguments\n\nA single and required argument is a function–callback.\n\n#### Returns\n\nA [`Subscription`](#subscription) object representing the subscription of the provided listener.\n\n### `addNotificationResponseReceivedListener(listener: (event: NotificationResponse) => void): void`\n\nListeners registered by this method will be called whenever a user interacts with a notification (eg. taps on it).\n\n#### Arguments\n\nA single and required argument is a function accepting notification response ([`NotificationResponse`](#notificationresponse)) as an argument.\n\n#### Returns\n\nA [`Subscription`](#subscription) object representing the subscription of the provided listener.\n\n#### Examples\n\n##### Registering a notification listener using a React hook\n\n```tsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { Linking } from 'react-native';\nimport * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';\n\nexport default function Container() {\n  React.useEffect(() => {\n    const subscription = Notifications.addNotificationResponseReceivedListener(response => {\n      const url = response.notification.request.content.data.url;\n      Linking.openUrl(url);\n    });\n    return () => subscription.remove();\n  }, []);\n\n  return (\n    // Your app content\n  );\n}\n```\n\n##### Handling push notifications with React Navigation\n\nIf you'd like to deep link to a specific screen in your app when you receive a push notification, you can configure React Navigation's [linking](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/navigation-container#linking) prop to do that:\n\n```tsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { Linking } from 'react-native';\nimport * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';\nimport { NavigationContainer } from '@react-navigation/native';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <NavigationContainer\n      linking={{\n        config: {\n          // Configuration for linking\n        },\n        subscribe(listener) {\n          const onReceiveURL = ({ url }: { url: string }) => listener(url);\n\n          // Listen to incoming links from deep linking\n          Linking.addEventListener('url', onReceiveURL);\n\n          // Listen to expo push notifications\n          const subscription = Notifications.addNotificationResponseReceivedListener((response) => {\n            const url = response.notification.request.content.data.url;\n\n            // Any custom logic to see whether the URL needs to be handled\n            //...\n\n            // Let React Navigation handle the URL\n            listener(url);\n          });\n\n          return () => {\n            // Clean up the event listeners\n            Linking.removeEventListener('url', onReceiveURL);\n            subscription.remove();\n          };\n        },\n      }}>\n      {/* Your app content */}\n    </NavigationContainer>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nSee more details on [React Navigation documentation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/deep-linking/#third-party-integrations).\n\n### `removeNotificationSubscription(subscription: Subscription): void`\n\nRemoves a notification subscription returned by a `addNotification*Listener` call.\n\n#### Arguments\n\nA single and required argument is a subscription returned by `addNotification*Listener`.\n\n## Handling incoming notifications when the app is in foreground\n\n### `setNotificationHandler(handler: NotificationHandler | null): void`\n\nWhen a notification is received while the app is running, using this function you can set a callback that will decide whether the notification should be shown to the user or not.\n\nWhen a notification is received, `handleNotification` is called with the incoming notification as an argument. The function should respond with a behavior object within 3 seconds, otherwise the notification will be discarded. If the notification is handled successfully, `handleSuccess` is called with the identifier of the notification, otherwise (or on timeout) `handleError` will be called.\n\nThe default behavior when the handler is not set or does not respond in time is not to show the notification.\n\n#### Arguments\n\nThe function receives a single argument which should be either `null` (if you want to clear the handler) or an object of fields:\n\n- **handleNotification (_(Notification) => Promise<NotificationBehavior>_**) -- (required) a function accepting an incoming notification returning a `Promise` resolving to a behavior ([`NotificationBehavior`](#notificationbehavior)) applicable to the notification\n- **handleSuccess (_(notificationId: string) => void_)** -- (optional) a function called whenever an incoming notification is handled successfully\n- **handleError (_(error: Error) => void_)** -- (optional) a function called whenever handling of an incoming notification fails\n\n#### Examples\n\nImplementing a notification handler that always shows the notification when it is received\n\n```ts\nimport * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';\n\nNotifications.setNotificationHandler({\n  handleNotification: async () => ({\n    shouldShowAlert: true,\n    shouldPlaySound: false,\n    shouldSetBadge: false,\n  }),\n});\n```\n\n## Handling incoming notifications when the app is not in the foreground (not supported in Expo Go)\n\n> **Please note:** In order to handle notifications while the app is backgrounded on iOS, you _must_ add `remote-notification` to the `ios.infoPlist.UIBackgroundModes` key in your app.json, **and** add `\"content-available\": 1` to your push notification payload. Under normal circumstances, the “content-available” flag should launch your app if it isn’t running and wasn’t killed by the user, _however_, this is ultimately decided by the OS so it might not always happen.\n\n### `registerTaskAsync(taskName: string): void`\n\nWhen a notification is received while the app is backgrounded, using this function you can set a callback that will be run in response to that notification. Under the hood, this function is run using `expo-task-manager`. You **must** define the task _first_, with [`TaskManager.defineTask`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/task-manager/#taskmanagerdefinetasktaskname-task). Make sure you define it in the global scope.\n\nThe `taskName` argument is the string you passed to `TaskManager.defineTask` as the \"taskName\". The callback function you define with `TaskManager.defineTask` will receive the following arguments:\n\n- **data**: The remote payload delivered by either FCM (Android) or APNs (iOS). [See here for details](#pushnotificationtrigger).\n- **error**: The error (if any) that occurred during execution of the task.\n- **executionInfo**: JSON object of additional info related to the task, including the `taskName`.\n\n#### Examples\n\n```ts\nimport * as TaskManager from 'expo-task-manager';\nimport * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';\n\nconst BACKGROUND_NOTIFICATION_TASK = 'BACKGROUND-NOTIFICATION-TASK';\n\nTaskManager.defineTask(BACKGROUND_NOTIFICATION_TASK, ({ data, error, executionInfo }) => {\n  console.log('Received a notification in the background!');\n  // Do something with the notification data\n});\n\nNotifications.registerTaskAsync(BACKGROUND_NOTIFICATION_TASK);\n```\n\n### `unregisterTaskAsync(taskName: string): void`\n\nUsed to unregister tasks registered with `registerTaskAsync`.\n\n## Fetching information about notifications-related permissions\n\n### `getPermissionsAsync(): Promise<NotificationPermissionsStatus>`\n\nCalling this function checks current permissions settings related to notifications. It lets you verify whether the app is currently allowed to display alerts, play sounds, etc. There is no user-facing effect of calling this.\n\n#### Returns\n\nIt returns a `Promise` resolving to an object representing permission settings (`NotificationPermissionsStatus`).\n\n#### Examples\n\nCheck if the app is allowed to send any type of notifications (interrupting and non-interrupting–provisional on iOS)\n\n```ts\nimport * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';\n\nexport async function allowsNotificationsAsync() {\n  const settings = await Notifications.getPermissionsAsync();\n  return (\n    settings.granted || settings.ios?.status === Notifications.IosAuthorizationStatus.PROVISIONAL\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### `requestPermissionsAsync(request?: NotificationPermissionsRequest): Promise<NotificationPermissionsStatus>`\n\nPrompts the user for notification permissions according to request. **Request defaults to asking the user to allow displaying alerts, setting badge count and playing sounds**.\n\n#### Arguments\n\nAn optional object of conforming to the following interface:\n\n```ts\n{\n  android?: {};\n  ios?: {\n    allowAlert?: boolean;\n    allowBadge?: boolean;\n    allowSound?: boolean;\n    allowDisplayInCarPlay?: boolean;\n    allowCriticalAlerts?: boolean;\n    provideAppNotificationSettings?: boolean;\n    allowProvisional?: boolean;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nEach option corresponds to a different native platform authorization option (a list of iOS options is available [here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/unauthorizationoptions), on Android all available permissions are granted by default and if a user declines any permission an app can't prompt the user to change).\n\n#### Returns\n\nIt returns a `Promise` resolving to an object representing permission settings (`NotificationPermissionsStatus`).\n\n#### Examples\n\nPrompts the user to allow the app to show alerts, play sounds, set badge count and let Siri read out messages through AirPods\n\n```ts\nimport * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';\n\nexport function requestPermissionsAsync() {\n  return await Notifications.requestPermissionsAsync({\n    ios: {\n      allowAlert: true,\n      allowBadge: true,\n      allowSound: true,\n    },\n  });\n}\n```\n\n## Managing application badge icon\n\n### `getBadgeCountAsync(): Promise<number>`\n\nFetches the number currently set as the badge of the app icon on device's home screen. A `0` value means that the badge is not displayed.\n\n> **Note:** Not all Android launchers support application badges. If the launcher does not support icon badges, the method will always resolve to `0`.\n\n#### Returns\n\nIt returns a `Promise` resolving to a number representing current badge of the app icon.\n\n### `setBadgeCountAsync(badgeCount: number, options?: SetBadgeCountOptions): Promise<boolean>`\n\nSets the badge of the app's icon to the specified number. Setting to `0` clears the badge.\n\n> **Note:** Not all Android launchers support application badges. If the launcher does not support icon badges, the method will resolve to `false`.\n\n#### Arguments\n\nThe function accepts a number as the first argument. A value of `0` will clear the badge.\n\nAs a second, optional argument you can pass in an object of options configuring behavior applied in Web environment. The object should be of format:\n\n```ts\n{\n  web?: badgin.Options\n}\n```\n\nwhere the type `badgin.Options` is an object described [in the `badgin`'s documentation](https://github.com/jaulz/badgin#options).\n\n#### Returns\n\nIt returns a `Promise` resolving to a boolean representing whether setting of the badge succeeded.\n\n## Scheduling notifications\n\n### `getAllScheduledNotificationsAsync(): Promise<Notification[]>`\n\nFetches information about all scheduled notifications.\n\n#### Returns\n\nIt returns a `Promise` resolving to an array of objects conforming to the [`Notification`](#notification) interface.\n\n### `presentNotificationAsync(content: NotificationContentInput, identifier?: string): Promise<string>`\n\nSchedules a notification for immediate trigger.\n\n> **Note:** This method has been deprecated in favor of using an explicit `NotificationHandler` and the `scheduleNotificationAsync` method. More info may be found at https://expo.fyi/presenting-notifications-deprecated.\n\n#### Arguments\n\nThe only argument to this function is a [`NotificationContentInput`](#notificationcontentinput).\n\n#### Returns\n\nIt returns a `Promise` resolving with the notification's identifier once the notification is successfully scheduled for immediate display.\n\n#### Examples\n\n##### Presenting the notification to the user (deprecated way)\n\n```ts\nimport * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';\n\nNotifications.presentNotificationAsync({\n  title: 'Look at that notification',\n  body: \"I'm so proud of myself!\",\n});\n```\n\n##### Presenting the notification to the user (recommended way)\n\n```ts\nimport * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';\n\n// First, set the handler that will cause the notification\n// to show the alert\n\nNotifications.setNotificationHandler({\n  handleNotification: async () => ({\n    shouldShowAlert: true,\n    shouldPlaySound: false,\n    shouldSetBadge: false,\n  }),\n});\n\n// Second, call the method\n\nNotifications.scheduleNotificationAsync({\n  content: {\n    title: 'Look at that notification',\n    body: \"I'm so proud of myself!\",\n  },\n  trigger: null,\n});\n```\n\n### `scheduleNotificationAsync(notificationRequest: NotificationRequestInput): Promise<string>`\n\nSchedules a notification to be triggered in the future.\n\n> **Note:** Please note that this does not mean that the notification will be presented when it is triggered. For the notification to be presented you have to set a notification handler with [`setNotificationHandler`](#setnotificationhandlerhandler-notificationhandler--null-void) that will return an appropriate notification behavior. For more information see the example below.\n\n#### Arguments\n\nThe one and only argument to this method is a [`NotificationRequestInput`](#notificationrequestinput) describing the notification to be triggered.\n\n#### Returns\n\nIt returns a `Promise` resolving to a string --- a notification identifier you can later use to cancel the notification or to identify an incoming notification.\n\n#### Examples\n\n##### Scheduling the notification that will trigger once, in one minute from now\n\n```ts\nimport * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';\n\nNotifications.scheduleNotificationAsync({\n  content: {\n    title: \"Time's up!\",\n    body: 'Change sides!',\n  },\n  trigger: {\n    seconds: 60,\n  },\n});\n```\n\n##### Scheduling the notification that will trigger repeatedly, every 20 minutes\n\n```ts\nimport * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';\n\nNotifications.scheduleNotificationAsync({\n  content: {\n    title: 'Remember to drink water!,\n  },\n  trigger: {\n    seconds: 60 * 20,\n    repeats: true\n  },\n});\n```\n\n##### Scheduling the notification that will trigger once, at the beginning of next hour\n\n```ts\nimport * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';\n\nconst trigger = new Date(Date.now() + 60 * 60 * 1000);\ntrigger.setMinutes(0);\ntrigger.setSeconds(0);\n\nNotifications.scheduleNotificationAsync({\n  content: {\n    title: 'Happy new hour!',\n  },\n  trigger,\n});\n```\n\n### `cancelScheduledNotificationAsync(identifier: string): Promise<void>`\n\nCancels a single scheduled notification. The scheduled notification of given ID will not trigger.\n\n#### Arguments\n\nThe notification identifier with which `scheduleNotificationAsync` resolved when the notification has been scheduled.\n\n#### Returns\n\nA `Promise` resolving once the scheduled notification is successfully cancelled or if there is no scheduled notification for given identifier.\n\n#### Examples\n\n##### Scheduling and then canceling the notification\n\n```ts\nimport * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';\n\nasync function scheduleAndCancel() {\n  const identifier = await Notifications.scheduleNotificationAsync({\n    content: {\n      title: 'Hey!',\n    },\n    trigger: { seconds: 5, repeats: true },\n  });\n  await Notifications.cancelScheduledNotificationAsync(identifier);\n}\n```\n\n### `cancelAllScheduledNotificationsAsync(): Promise<void>`\n\nCancels all scheduled notifications.\n\n#### Returns\n\nA `Promise` resolving once all the scheduled notifications are successfully cancelled or if there are no scheduled notifications.\n\n### `getNextTriggerDateAsync(trigger: SchedulableNotificationTriggerInput): Promise<number | null>`\n\nAllows you to check what will be the next trigger date for given notification trigger input.\n\n#### Arguments\n\nThe schedulable notification trigger you would like to check next trigger date for (of type [`SchedulableNotificationTriggerInput`](#schedulablenotificationtriggerinput)).\n\n#### Returns\n\nIf the return value is `null`, the notification won't be triggered. Otherwise, the return value is the Unix timestamp in milliseconds at which the notification will be triggered.\n\n#### Examples\n\n##### Calculating next trigger date for a notification trigger\n\n```ts\nimport * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';\n\nasync function logNextTriggerDate() {\n  try {\n    const nextTriggerDate = await Notifications.getNextTriggerDateAsync({\n      hour: 9,\n      minute: 0,\n    });\n    console.log(nextTriggerDate === null ? 'No next trigger date' : new Date(nextTriggerDate));\n  } catch (e) {\n    console.warn(`Couldn't have calculated next trigger date: ${e}`);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Dismissing notifications\n\n### `getPresentedNotificationsAsync(): Promise<Notification[]>`\n\nFetches information about all notifications present in the notification tray (Notification Center).\n\n> **Note:** This method is not supported on Android below 6.0 (API level 23) – on these devices it will resolve to an empty array.\n\n#### Returns\n\nA `Promise` resolving with a list of notifications ([`Notification`](#notification)) currently present in the notification tray (Notification Center).\n\n### `dismissNotificationAsync(identifier: string): Promise<void>`\n\nRemoves notification displayed in the notification tray (Notification Center).\n\n#### Arguments\n\nThe first and only argument to the function is the notification identifier, obtained either in `setNotificationHandler` or in the listener added with `addNotificationReceivedListener`.\n\n#### Returns\n\nResolves once the request to dismiss the notification is successfully dispatched to the notifications manager.\n\n### `dismissAllNotificationsAsync(): Promise<void>`\n\nRemoves all application's notifications displayed in the notification tray (Notification Center).\n\n#### Returns\n\nResolves once the request to dismiss the notifications is successfully dispatched to the notifications manager.\n\n## Managing notification channels (Android-specific)\n\n> Starting in Android 8.0 (API level 26), all notifications must be assigned to a channel. For each channel, you can set the visual and auditory behavior that is applied to all notifications in that channel. Then, users can change these settings and decide which notification channels from your app should be intrusive or visible at all. [(source: developer.android.com)](https://developer.android.com/training/notify-user/channels)\n\nIf you do not specify a notification channel, `expo-notifications` will create a fallback channel for you, named _Miscellaneous_. We encourage you to always ensure appropriate channels with informative names are set up for the application and to always send notifications to these channels.\n\nCalling these methods is a no-op for platforms that do not support this feature (iOS, Web and Android below version 8.0 (26)).\n\n### `getNotificationChannelsAsync(): Promise<NotificationChannel[]>`\n\nFetches information about all known notification channels.\n\n#### Returns\n\nA `Promise` resolving to an array of channels. On platforms that do not support notification channels, it will always resolve to an empty array.\n\n### `getNotificationChannelAsync(identifier: string): Promise<NotificationChannel | null>`\n\nFetches information about a single notification channel.\n\n#### Arguments\n\nThe only argument to this method is the channel's identifier.\n\n#### Returns\n\nA `Promise` resolving to the channel object (of type [`NotificationChannel`](#notificationchannel)) or to `null` if there was no channel found for this identifier. On platforms that do not support notification channels, it will always resolve to `null`.\n\n### `setNotificationChannelAsync(identifier: string, channel: NotificationChannelInput): Promise<NotificationChannel | null>`\n\nAssigns the channel configuration to a channel of a specified name (creating it if need be). This method lets you assign given notification channel to a notification channel group.\n\n> **Note:** For some settings to be applied on all Android versions, it may be necessary to duplicate the configuration across both a single notification _and_ it's respective notification channel. For example, for a notification to play a custom sound on Android versions **below** 8.0, the custom notification sound has to be set on the notification (through the [`NotificationContentInput`](#notificationcontentinput)), and for the custom sound to play on Android versions **above** 8.0, the relevant notification channel must have the custom sound configured (through the [`NotificationChannelInput`](#notificationchannelinput)). For more information, see [\"Setting custom notification sounds on Android\"](#setting-custom-notification-sounds-on-android).\n\n#### Arguments\n\nFirst argument to the method is the channel identifier.\n\nSecond argument is the channel's configuration of type [`NotificationChannelInput`](#notificationchannelinput)\n\n#### Returns\n\nA `Promise` resolving to the object (of type [`NotificationChannel`](#notificationchannel)) describing the modified channel or to `null` if the platform does not support notification channels.\n\n### `deleteNotificationChannelAsync(identifier: string): Promise<void>`\n\nRemoves the notification channel.\n\n#### Arguments\n\nFirst and only argument to the method is the channel identifier.\n\n#### Returns\n\nA `Promise` resolving once the channel is removed (or if there was no channel for given identifier).\n\n### `getNotificationChannelGroupsAsync(): Promise<NotificationChannelGroup[]>`\n\nFetches information about all known notification channel groups.\n\n#### Returns\n\nA `Promise` resolving to an array of channel groups. On platforms that do not support notification channel groups, it will always resolve to an empty array.\n\n### `getNotificationChannelGroupAsync(identifier: string): Promise<NotificationChannelGroup | null>`\n\nFetches information about a single notification channel group.\n\n#### Arguments\n\nThe only argument to this method is the channel group's identifier.\n\n#### Returns\n\nA `Promise` resolving to the channel group object (of type [`NotificationChannelGroup`](#notificationchannelgroup)) or to `null` if there was no channel group found for this identifier. On platforms that do not support notification channels, it will always resolve to `null`.\n\n### `setNotificationChannelGroupAsync(identifier: string, channel: NotificationChannelGroupInput): Promise<NotificationChannelGroup | null>`\n\nAssigns the channel group configuration to a channel group of a specified name (creating it if need be).\n\n#### Arguments\n\nFirst argument to the method is the channel group identifier.\n\nSecond argument is the channel group's configuration of type [`NotificationChannelGroupInput`](#notificationchannelgroupinput)\n\n#### Returns\n\nA `Promise` resolving to the object (of type [`NotificationChannelGroup`](#notificationchannelgroup)) describing the modified channel group or to `null` if the platform does not support notification channels.\n\n### `deleteNotificationChannelGroupAsync(identifier: string): Promise<void>`\n\nRemoves the notification channel group and all notification channels that belong to it.\n\n#### Arguments\n\nFirst and only argument to the method is the channel group identifier.\n\n#### Returns\n\nA `Promise` resolving once the channel group is removed (or if there was no channel group for given identifier).\n\n## Managing notification categories (interactive notifications)\n\nNotification categories allow you to create interactive push notifications, so that a user can respond directly to the incoming notification either via buttons or a text response. A category defines the set of actions a user can take, and then those actions are applied to a notification by specifying the `categoryIdentifier` in the [`NotificationContent`](#notificationcontent).\n\nOn iOS, notification categories also allow you to customize your notifications further. With each category, not only can you set interactive actions a user can take, but you can also configure things like the placeholder text to display when the user disables notification previews for your app.\n\nCalling one of the following methods is a no-op on Web.\n\n### `setNotificationCategoryAsync(identifier: string, actions: NotificationAction[], options: CategoryOptions): Promise<NotificationCategory | null>`\n\n#### Arguments\n\n- `identifier`: A string to associate as the ID of this category. You will pass this string in as the `categoryIdentifier` in your [`NotificationContent`](#notificationcontent) to associate a notification with this category.\n- `actions`: An array of [`NotificationAction`s](#notificationaction), which describe the actions associated with this category. Each of these actions takes the shape:\n  - `identifier`: A unique string that identifies this action. If a user takes this action (i.e. selects this button in the system's Notification UI), your app will receive this `actionIdentifier` via the [`NotificationResponseReceivedListener`](#addnotificationresponsereceivedlistenerlistener-event-notificationresponse--void-void).\n  - `buttonTitle`: The title of the button triggering this action.\n  - `textInput`: **Optional** object which, if provided, will result in a button that prompts the user for a text response.\n    - `submitButtonTitle`: (**iOS only**) A string which will be used as the title for the button used for submitting the text response.\n    - `placeholder`: A string that serves as a placeholder until the user begins typing. Defaults to no placeholder string.\n  - `options`: **Optional** object of additional configuration options.\n    - `opensAppToForeground`: Boolean indicating whether triggering this action foregrounds the app (defaults to `true`). If `false` and your app is killed (not just backgrounded), [`NotificationResponseReceived` listeners](#addnotificationresponsereceivedlistenerlistener-event-notificationresponse--void-void) will not be triggered when a user selects this action.\n    - `isAuthenticationRequired`: (**iOS only**) Boolean indicating whether triggering the action will require authentication from the user.\n    - `isDestructive`: (**iOS only**) Boolean indicating whether the button title will be highlighted a different color (usually red). This usually signifies a destructive action such as deleting data.\n- `options`: An optional object of additional configuration options for your category (**these are all iOS only**):\n  - `previewPlaceholder`: Customizable placeholder for the notification preview text. This is shown if the user has disabled notification previews for the app. Defaults to the localized iOS system default placeholder (`Notification`).\n  - `intentIdentifiers`: Array of [Intent Class Identifiers](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/sirikit/intent_class_identifiers). When a notification is delivered, the presence of an intent identifier lets the system know that the notification is potentially related to the handling of a request made through Siri. Defaults to an empty array.\n  - `categorySummaryFormat`: A format string for the summary description used when the system groups the category’s notifications.\n  - `customDismissAction`: A boolean indicating whether to send actions for handling when the notification is dismissed (the user must explicitly dismiss the notification interface- ignoring a notification or flicking away a notification banner does not trigger this action). Defaults to `false`.\n  - `allowInCarPlay`: A boolean indicating whether to allow CarPlay to display notifications of this type. **Apps must be approved for CarPlay to make use of this feature.** Defaults to `false`.\n  - `showTitle`: A boolean indicating whether to show the notification's title, even if the user has disabled notification previews for the app. Defaults to `false`.\n  - `showSubtitle`: A boolean indicating whether to show the notification's subtitle, even if the user has disabled notification previews for the app. Defaults to `false`.\n  - `allowAnnouncement`: A boolean indicating whether to allow notifications to be automatically read by Siri when the user is using AirPods. Defaults to `false`.\n\n#### Returns\n\nA `Promise` resolving to the category you just created.\n\n### `getNotificationCategoriesAsync(): Promise<NotificationCategory[]>`\n\nFetches information about all known notification categories.\n\n#### Returns\n\nA `Promise` resolving to an array of `NotificationCategory`s. On platforms that do not support notification channels, it will always resolve to an empty array.\n\n### `deleteNotificationCategoryAsync(identifier: string): Promise<boolean>`\n\nDeletes the category associated with the provided identifier.\n\n#### Arguments\n\nIdentifier initially provided to `setNotificationCategoryAsync` when creating the category.\n\n#### Returns\n\nA `Promise` resolving to `true` if the category was successfully deleted, or `false` if it was not. An example of when this method would return `false` is if you try to delete a category that doesn't exist.\n\n## Types\n\n### `DevicePushToken`\n\nIn simple terms, an object of `type: Platform.OS` and `data: any`. The `data` type depends on the environment -- on a native device it will be a string, which you can then use to send notifications via Firebase Cloud Messaging (Android) or APNS (iOS); on web it will be a registration object (VAPID).\n\n```ts\nexport interface NativeDevicePushToken {\n  type: 'ios' | 'android';\n  data: string;\n}\n\nexport interface WebDevicePushToken {\n  type: 'web';\n  data: {\n    endpoint: string;\n    keys: {\n      p256dh: string;\n      auth: string;\n    };\n  };\n}\n\nexport type DevicePushToken = NativeDevicePushToken | WebDevicePushToken;\n```\n\n### `PushTokenListener`\n\nA function accepting a device push token ([`DevicePushToken`](#devicepushtoken)) as an argument.\n\n> **Note:** You should not call `getDevicePushTokenAsync` inside this function, as it triggers the listener and may lead to an infinite loop.\n\n### `ExpoPushToken`\n\nBorrowing from `DevicePushToken` a little bit, it's an object of `type: 'expo'` and `data: string`. You can use the `data` value to send notifications via Expo Notifications service.\n\n```ts\nexport interface ExpoPushToken {\n  type: 'expo';\n  data: string;\n}\n```\n\n### `Subscription`\n\nA common-in-React-Native type to abstract an active subscription. Call `.remove()` to remove the subscription. You can then discard the object.\n\n```ts\nexport type Subscription = {\n  remove: () => void;\n};\n```\n\n### `Notification`\n\nAn object representing a single notification that has been triggered by some request ([`NotificationRequest`](#notificationrequest)) at some point in time.\n\n```ts\nexport interface Notification {\n  date: number;\n  request: NotificationRequest;\n}\n```\n\n### `NotificationRequest`\n\nAn object representing a request to present a notification. It has content — how it's being represented — and a trigger — what triggers the notification. Many notifications ([`Notification`](#notification)) may be triggered with the same request (eg. a repeating notification).\n\n```ts\nexport interface NotificationRequest {\n  identifier: string;\n  content: NotificationContent;\n  trigger: NotificationTrigger;\n}\n```\n\n### `NotificationContent`\n\nAn object representing notification's content.\n\n```ts\nexport type NotificationContent = {\n  // Notification title - the bold text displayed above the rest of the content\n  title: string | null;\n  // On iOS - subtitle - the bold text displayed between title and the rest of the content\n  // On Android - subText - the display depends on the platform\n  subtitle: string | null;\n  // Notification body - the main content of the notification\n  body: string | null;\n  // Data associated with the notification, not displayed\n  data: { [key: string]: unknown };\n  // Application badge number associated with the notification\n  badge: number | null;\n  sound: 'default' | 'defaultCritical' | 'custom' | null;\n} & (\n  | {\n      // iOS-specific additions\n      // See https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/unnotificationcontent?language=objc\n      // for more information on specific fields.\n      launchImageName: string | null;\n      attachments: {\n        identifier: string | null;\n        url: string | null;\n        type: string | null;\n      }[];\n      summaryArgument?: string | null;\n      summaryArgumentCount?: number;\n      categoryIdentifier: string | null;\n      threadIdentifier: string | null;\n      targetContentIdentifier?: string;\n    }\n  | {\n      // Android-specific additions\n      // See https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Notification.html#fields\n      // for more information on specific fields.\n      priority?: AndroidNotificationPriority;\n      vibrationPattern?: number[];\n      // Format: '#AARRGGBB'\n      color?: string;\n    }\n);\n```\n\n### `NotificationContentInput`\n\nAn object representing notification content that you pass in to `presentNotificationAsync` or as a part of `NotificationRequestInput`.\n\n```ts\nexport interface NotificationContentInput {\n  // Fields corresponding to NotificationContent\n  title?: string;\n  subtitle?: string;\n  body?: string;\n  data?: { [key: string]: unknown };\n  badge?: number;\n  sound?: boolean | string;\n  // Android-specific fields\n  // See https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Notification.html#fields\n  // for more information on specific fields.\n  vibrate?: boolean | number[];\n  priority?: AndroidNotificationPriority;\n  // Format: '#AARRGGBB', '#RRGGBB' or one of the named colors,\n  // see https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/android/graphics/Color?hl=en\n  color?: string;\n  // If set to false, the notification will not be automatically dismissed when clicked.\n  // The setting used when the value is not provided or is invalid is true (the notification\n  // will be dismissed automatically). Corresponds directly to Android's `setAutoCancel`\n  // behavior. In Firebase terms this property of a notification is called `sticky`.\n  // See:\n  // - https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Notification.Builder#setAutoCancel(boolean),\n  // - https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/fcm/rest/v1/projects.messages#AndroidNotification.FIELDS.sticky\n  autoDismiss?: boolean;\n  // iOS-specific fields\n  // See https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/unmutablenotificationcontent?language=objc\n  // for more information on specific fields.\n  launchImageName?: string;\n  attachments?: {\n    url: string;\n    identifier?: string;\n\n    typeHint?: string;\n    hideThumbnail?: boolean;\n    thumbnailClipArea?: { x: number; y: number; width: number; height: number };\n    thumbnailTime?: number;\n  }[];\n}\n```\n\n### `NotificationRequestInput`\n\nAn object representing a notification request you can pass into `scheduleNotificationAsync`.\n\n```ts\nexport interface NotificationRequestInput {\n  identifier?: string;\n  content: NotificationContentInput;\n  trigger: NotificationTriggerInput;\n}\n```\n\n### `AndroidNotificationPriority`\n\nAn enum corresponding to values appropriate for Android's [`Notification#priority`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Notification#priority) field.\n\n```ts\nexport enum AndroidNotificationPriority {\n  MIN = 'min',\n  LOW = 'low',\n  DEFAULT = 'default',\n  HIGH = 'high',\n  MAX = 'max',\n}\n```\n\n### `NotificationTrigger`\n\nA union type containing different triggers which may cause the notification to be delivered to the application.\n\n```ts\nexport type NotificationTrigger =\n  | PushNotificationTrigger\n  | CalendarNotificationTrigger\n  | LocationNotificationTrigger\n  | TimeIntervalNotificationTrigger\n  | DailyNotificationTrigger\n  | WeeklyNotificationTrigger\n  | YearlyNotificationTrigger\n  | UnknownNotificationTrigger;\n```\n\n### `PushNotificationTrigger`\n\nAn object representing a notification delivered by a push notification system.\n\nOn Android under `remoteMessage` field a JS version of the Firebase `RemoteMessage` may be accessed.

You can use the following resize modes to obtain behavior as if you were using the React Native `<Image>` component's `resizeMode` style.\n\n#### `CONTAIN` resize mode\n\nScale the image uniformly (maintaining the image's aspect ratio) so that both dimensions the width and height of the image will be equal to or less than the corresponding dimension of the device's screen.\n\n<table>\n  <thead><tr><td>Android</td><td>iOS</td></tr></thead>\n  <tbody><tr>\n<td>\n\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/379606/120575867-aeeb3580-c3d6-11eb-825d-19a847fe30f5.mp4\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/379606/120575885-b6124380-c3d6-11eb-8485-75a11832962c.mp4\n\n</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n#### `COVER` resize mode\n\nScale the image uniformly (maintaining the image's aspect ratio) so that both the width and height of the image will be equal to or larger than the corresponding dimension of the device's screen.\n\n<table>\n  <thead><tr><td>Android</td><td>iOS</td></tr></thead>\n  <tbody><tr>\n<td>\n\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/379606/120575871-b1e62600-c3d6-11eb-9435-5dee19791294.mp4\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/379606/120575890-b7437080-c3d6-11eb-9c0a-3c563d1ee02a.mp4\n\n</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n#### `NATIVE` resize mode\n\n> **Android only.**\n\nBy using this resize mode your app will will leverage Android's ability to present a static bitmap while the application is starting up.\nAndroid (unlike iOS) does not support stretching of the provided image during launch, so the application will present the given image centered on the screen at its original dimensions.\n\n<table>\n  <thead><tr><td>Android</td></tr></thead>\n  <tbody><tr>\n<td>\n\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/379606/120575878-b3afe980-c3d6-11eb-80c1-72441c22e8be.mp4\n\n</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n> Animation above presents one of our [known issues](#native-mode-pushes-splash-image-up-a-little-bit)\n\nSelecting this resize mode requires some more work to be done in native configuration.\nPlease take a look at the [`res/drawable/splashscreen.xml`](#resdrawablesplashscreenxml) and [`res/drawable/splashscreen_background.png`](#resdrawablesplashscreen_backgroundpng) sections.\n\n### Per-appearance (a.k.a. dark-mode) splash screen\n\n`expo-splash-screen` supports per-appearance splash screens that respond to system appearance changes on iOS 13+ and dark-mode changes on Android 10+.\n\n### StatusBar customization\n\n`expo-splash-screen` allows customization of the StatusBar according to the [ReactNative StatusBar API](https://reactnative.dev/docs/statusbar).\n\n## 📚 API\n\n```tsx\nimport * as SplashScreen from 'expo-splash-screen';\n```\n\nThe native splash screen that is controlled via this module autohides once the ReactNative-controlled view hierarchy is mounted. This means that when your app first `render`s view component, the native splash screen will hide. This default behavior can be prevented by calling [`SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync()`](#splashscreenpreventautohideasync) and later on [`SplashScreen.hideAsync()`](#splashscreenhideasync).\n\n### `SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync()`\n\nThis method makes the native splash screen stay visible until [`SplashScreen.hideAsync()`](#splashscreenhideasync) is called. This must be called before any ReactNative-controlled view hierarchy is rendered (either in the global scope of your main component, or when the component renders `null` at the beginning - see [Examples section](#-examples)).\n\nPreventing default autohiding might come in handy if your application needs to prepare/download some resources and/or make some API calls before first rendering some actual view hierarchy.\n\n#### Returns\n\nA `Promise` that resolves to `true` when preventing autohiding succeeded and to `false` if the native splash screen is already prevented from autohiding (for instance, if you've already called this method).\n`Promise` rejection most likely means that native splash screen cannot be prevented from autohiding (it's already hidden when this method was executed).\n\n### `SplashScreen.hideAsync()`\n\nHides the native splash screen. Only works if the native splash screen has been previously prevented from autohiding by calling [`SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync()`](#splashscreenpreventautohideasync) method.\n\n#### Returns\n\nA `Promise` that resolves to `true` once the splash screen becomes hidden and to `false` if the splash screen is already hidden.\n\n## 🗒 Examples\n\n### `SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync()` in global scope\n\n`App.tsx`\n\n```tsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { StyleSheet, Text, View } from 'react-native';\nimport * as SplashScreen from 'expo-splash-screen';\n\n// Prevent native splash screen from autohiding before App component declaration\nSplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync()\n  .then((result) => console.log(`SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync() succeeded: ${result}`))\n  .catch(console.warn); // it's good to explicitly catch and inspect any error\n\nexport default class App extends React.Component {\n  componentDidMount() {\n    // Hides native splash screen after 2s\n    setTimeout(async () => {\n      await SplashScreen.hideAsync();\n    }, 2000);\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <View style={styles.container}>\n        <Text style={styles.text}>SplashScreen Demo! 👋</Text>\n      </View>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    flex: 1,\n    alignItems: 'center',\n    justifyContent: 'center',\n    backgroundColor: '#aabbcc',\n  },\n  text: {\n    color: 'white',\n    fontWeight: 'bold',\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### `SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync()` in component that initially renders `null`\n\n`App.tsx`\n\n```tsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { StyleSheet, Text, View } from 'react-native';\nimport * as SplashScreen from 'expo-splash-screen';\n\nexport default class App extends React.Component {\n  state = {\n    appIsReady: false,\n  };\n\n  async componentDidMount() {\n    // Prevent native splash screen from autohiding\n    try {\n      await SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync();\n    } catch (e) {\n      console.warn(e);\n    }\n    this.prepareResources();\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Method that serves to load resources and make API calls\n   */\n  prepareResources = async () => {\n    await performAPICalls(...);\n    await downloadAssets(...);\n\n    this.setState({ appIsReady: true }, async () => {\n      await SplashScreen.hideAsync();\n    });\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    if (!this.state.appIsReady) {\n      return null;\n    }\n\n    return (\n      <View style={styles.container}>\n        <Text style={styles.text}>SplashScreen Demo! 👋</Text>\n      </View>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    flex: 1,\n    alignItems: 'center',\n    justifyContent: 'center',\n    backgroundColor: '#aabbcc',\n  },\n  text: {\n    color: 'white',\n    fontWeight: 'bold',\n  },\n});\n```\n\n## 💻 Installation in managed Expo projects\n\nRefer to [the SplashScreen section of the Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/splash-screen/).\n\n## 🖥 Installation in bare React Native projects\n\nFor bare React Native projects, you must ensure that you have [installed and configured the `expo` package](https://docs.expo.dev/bare/installing-expo-modules/) before continuing.\n\n## Add the package to your dependencies\n\n```\nnpx expo install expo-splash-screen\n```\n\n## 📱 Configure iOS\n\nRun `npx pod-install` after installing the package.\n\n### Manual Configuration\n\nTo achieve native splash screen (in iOS ecosystem it's called `LaunchScreen`) behavior, you have to provide either a `SplashScreen.storyboard` file or a `SplashScreen.xib` file, and configure your Xcode project accordingly.\n\nThe guide below shows how to configure your Xcode project to use a single image file as a splash screen using a `.storyboard` file (configuration for `.xib` filetype is analogous).\n\n1. [Add an image to `Images.xcassets`](#-add-an-image-to-imagesxcassets)\n2. [Create `SplashScreen.storyboard`](#-create-splashscreenstoryboard)\n3. [Select `Content Mode` for the `ImageView` in `SplashScreen.storyboard`](#-select-content-mode-for-the-imageview-in-splashscreenstoryboard)\n4. [Mark `SplashScreen.storyboard` as the LaunchScreen](#-mark-splashscreenstoryboard-as-the-launchscreen)\n5. [(<em>optional</em>) Enable dark mode](#-optional-enable-dark-mode)\n6. [(<em>optional</em>) Customize StatusBar](#-customize-statusbar)\n\n#### 🛠 Add an image to `Images.xcassets`\n\nFirst you need to add the image file that would serve as a splash screen to your native project's resources.\n\n1. In your Xcode project open the `.xcassets` (often named `Images.xcassets` or `Assets.xcassets`) file.\n2. In the content panel add `New image set` and name it `SplashScreen`.\n3. Provide the splash screen image you've prepared (you have to provide it in three different scales).\n\n<details>\n <summary>Show image with details</summary>\n<img src=\"./assets/configuration-ios-addImagesXcassets.png\" height=\"350\" />\n</details>\n\n#### 🛠 Create `SplashScreen.storyboard`\n\nThis is the actual splash screen definition and will be used by the system to render your splash screen.\n\n1. Create a `SplashScreen.storyboard` file.\n2. Add a `View Controller` to the newly created `.storyboard` file:\n   - open `Library` (`+` button on the top-right),\n   - find `View Controller` element,\n   - drag-and-drop it to the `.storyboard` file.\n\n<details>\n <summary>Show image with details</summary>\n<img src=\"./assets/configuration-ios-addViewControllerToStoryboard.png\" height=\"350\" />\n</details>\n\n3. Add an `Image View` to the `View Controller`:\n   - first remove other `View` element from `View Controller`,\n   - open `Library` (`+` button on the top-right),\n   - find `Image View` element,\n   - drag-and-drop it as a `View Controller` child in view hierarchy inspector.\n\n<details>\n <summary>Show image with details</summary>\n<img src=\"./assets/configuration-ios-addImageViewToStoryboard.png\" height=\"350\" />\n</details>\n\n4. Set `Storyboard ID` to `SplashScreenViewController`:\n   - select `View Controller` in view hierarchy inspector,\n   - navigate to `Identity Inspector` in the right panel,\n   - and set `Storyboard ID` to `SplashScreenViewController`.\n\n<details>\n <summary>Show image with details</summary>\n<img src=\"./assets/configuration-ios-addStoryboardID.png\" height=\"350\" />\n</details>\n\n5. Tick `Is Initial View Controller` in `SplashScreenViewController`:\n   - select `View Controller` in view hierarchy inspector,\n   - navigate to `Attributes Inspector` in the right panel,\n   - and tick `Is Initial View Controller` in View Controller section.\n\n<details>\n <summary>Show image with details</summary>\n<img src=\"./assets/configuration-ios-tickIsInitialViewController.png\" height=\"350\" />\n</details>\n\n6. Configure `Image View` source:\n   - select `Image View` in view hierarchy inspector,\n   - navigate to `Attributes Inspector` in the right panel,\n   - select `SplashScreen` in `Image` parameter).\n\n<details>\n <summary>Show image with details</summary>\n<img src=\"./assets/configuration-ios-configureImageView.png\" height=\"350\" />\n</details>\n\n7. Configure `Background` of the `Image View`:\n   - select `Image View` in view hierarchy inspector,\n   - navigate to `Attributes Inspector` in the right panel,\n   - configure `Background` parameter:\n     - To enter a `#RRGGBB` value you need to select `Custom` option and in the `Colors Popup` that appeared you need to navigate to the second tab and choose `RGB Sliders` from dropdown select.\n\n<details>\n <summary>Show image with details</summary>\n<img src=\"./assets/configuration-ios-selectBackgroundColor.png\" height=\"350\" />\n</details>\n\n#### 🛠 Select `Content Mode` for the `ImageView` in `SplashScreen.storyboard`\n\nThis is how your image will be displayed on the screen.\n\n1. Open `SplashScreen.storyboard` and select `Image View` from `View Controller`.\n2. Navigate to `Attributes Inspector` in the right panel and locate `Content Mode`.\n3. Select one of the following:\n   - `Aspect Fit` to obtain [CONTAIN resize mode](#contain-resize-mode),\n   - `Aspect Fill` to obtain [COVER resize mode](#cover-resize-mode).\n4. You can always choose other options to achieve different image positioning and scaling.\n\n<details>\n <summary>Show image with details</summary>\n<img src=\"./assets/configuration-ios-selectImageViewContentMode.png\" height=\"350\" />\n</details>\n\n#### 🛠 Mark `SplashScreen.storyboard` as the LaunchScreen\n\nThe newly created `SplashScreen.storyboard` needs to be marked as the `Launch Screen File` in your Xcode project in order to be presented from the very beginning of your application launch.\n\n1. Select your project in `Project Navigator`\n2. Select your project name from `TARGETS` panel and navigate to `General` tab.\n3. Locate `App Icons and Launch Images` section and `Launch Screen File` option.\n4. Select or enter `SplashScreen` as the value for located option.\n\n<details>\n <summary>Show image with details</summary>\n<img src=\"./assets/configuration-ios-selectLaunchScreen.png\" height=\"350\" />\n</details>\n\n#### 🛠 (<em>optional</em>) Enable dark mode\n\n##### Provide different background colors\n\nDepending on what iOS version your application is targeting, you have to adjust your native project differently to a obtain working per-appearance splash screen view.\n\n##### I'm targeting iOS 11+\n\nYou can take advantage of [`named colors`](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/WhatsNewXcode/xcode_9/xcode_9.html) in your Xcode project.\n\n1. Create a new `Color Set` and customize its values for different color modes:\n   - in your `.xcassets` directory (either create a new `.xcassets` for colors, or reuse an existing one e.g. with images) create `New Color Set` and name it `SplashScreenBackground`,\n   - navigate to `Attributes Inspector` in the right panel and change `Appearance` to `Any, Dark`,\n   - select desired color in `Attributes Inspector` in the right panel for each mode.\n\n<details>\n <summary>Show image with details</summary>\n<img src=\"./assets/configuration-ios-createNamedColor.png\" height=\"350\" />\n</details>\n\n2. Select created `named color` as the `Background` for the `Image View` in `SplashScreen.storyboard`:\n   - open `SplashScreen.storyboard` and select `Image View` in view hierarchy inspector,\n   - navigate to `Attributes Inspector` in the right panel,\n   - configure `Background` parameter by selecting your created `named color` (that should be listed as `SplashScreenBackground`).\n\n<details>\n <summary>Show image with details</summary>\n<img src=\"./assets/configuration-ios-selectNamedColor.png\" height=\"350\" />\n</details>\n\n##### I'm targeting iOS version < 11\n\nYou cannot use [`named colors`](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/WhatsNewXcode/xcode_9/xcode_9.html) feature in your Xcode project.\nInstead you have to create an additional image set that contains small 1x1px images, each with the desired background color. Then, you'll use this additional image resource as a background in the splash screen view.\n\nYou can use this online generator to obtain 1x1px `.png` images with desired colors: http://www.1x1px.me.\n\n1. Create `SplashScreenBackground` `Image Set` with desired background colors for each mode in your `Images.xcassets` directory:\n   - open your `.xcassets` directory with images,\n   - in the content panel add `New image set` and name it `SplashScreenBackground`,\n   - convert this `Image set` to support `Dark Appearance` by navigating to `Attributes Inspector` in the right panel and changing `Appearance` to `Any, Dark`,\n   - provide images with colors for every mode (you can generate color 1x1px images using http://www.1x1px.me).\n\n<details>\n <summary>Show image with details</summary>\n<img src=\"./assets/configuration-ios-addSplashScreenBackgroundImages.png\" height=\"250\" />\n</details>\n\n2. Update `SplashScreen.storyboard` to consist of a single top-level `View` with two `Image View` subviews (solid-colored image in the background and actual splash screen image in the foreground):\n\n   - open `SplashScreen.storyboard` and replace `Image View` with a plain `View` (search `Library` for it and drag&drop it in place of current `Image View`),\n   - add two\n\n3. Configure first `Image View` (background color):\n   - configure attributes in `Attributes Inspector`:\n     - set `Image` to `SplashScreenBackground` (prepared in previous step),\n     - set `Content Mode` to `Scale To Fill` (color needs to take all available space),\n   - make this subview take all available space in parent view:\n     - open `Add new constraints` bottom menu,\n     - make sure `Constrain to margin` is not checked,\n     - for every input, open the dropdown and select `View` (parent view reference) and set `0` as the value,\n     - once every side is covered (`0` value and parent view reference selected in dropdown) hit `Add 4 Constraints`,\n     - observe that in `View Hierarchy Inspector` constraints are added and `Image View` resized to take whole place of parent view.\n\n<details>\n <summary>Show image with details</summary>\n<img src=\"./assets/configuration-ios-createBackgroundImageView.png\" height=\"350\" />\n</details>\n\n4. Configure second `Image View` (actual splash screen image):\n   - select second `Image View` and select correct `Image` in `Attributes Inspector` alongside with desired `Content Mode`,\n   - make this subview take all available space in parent view (see previous step).\n\n<details>\n <summary>Show image with details</summary>\n<img src=\"./assets/configuration-ios-addConstraintsToImageViews.png\" height=\"350\" />\n</details>\n\n##### Provide different splash screen image\n\nYou might want to add a separate image for `dark` mode. If the system is switched to `dark` mode, it would pick this different image instead of the normal one and present it in the splash screen view.\n\n1. In your Xcode project open `SplashScreen` (created in previous section).\n2. Convert this asset to support `Dark Appearance`:\n\n- navigate to `Attributes Inspector` in the right panel,\n- locate `Appearances` section and select `Any, Dark`,\n- provide image for `dark mode` by dropping it to the correct box.\n\n<details>\n <summary>Show image with details</summary>\n<img src=\"./assets/configuration-ios-addDarkImagesXcassets.png\" height=\"280\" />\n</details>\n\n###### Background color when you want to support iOS < 11\n\nIf you're targeting a version of iOS < 11 then you cannot use `named color` feature and instead you need to generate images with desired background colors that are going to be used as the background for splash screen view.\nThere is this awesome 1x1px png online generator: http://www.1x1px.me (use it to generate two 1x1px images with desired background colors for different color modes).\n\n#### 🛠 (<em>optional</em>) Customize StatusBar\n\nYou might want to customize the StatusBar appearance during the time the SplashScreen is being shown.\n\n1. Customize `StatusBar hiding` flag:\n\n- open main project view, select your project name from `TARGETS` panel and navigate to `Info` tab,\n- add or modify `Status bar initially hidden` attribute with desired value.\n\n<details>\n <summary>Show image with details</summary>\n<img src=\"./assets/configuration-ios-statusBar-hidden.png\" height=\"350\" />\n</details>\n\n2. Customize `StatusBar style` option:\n\n- open main project view, select your project name from `TARGETS` panel and navigate to `Info` tab,\n- add or modify `Status bar style` attribute with desired value.\n\n<details>\n <summary>Show image with details</summary>\n<img src=\"./assets/configuration-ios-statusBar-style.png\" height=\"350\" />\n</details>\n\n## 🤖 Configure Android\n\nTo achieve fully-native splash screen behavior, `expo-splash-screen` needs to be hooked into the native view hierarchy and consume some resources that have to be placed under `/android/app/src/res` directory.\n\n### Manual Configuration\n\n1. [Configure `res/drawable/splashscreen_image.png`](#-configure-resdrawablesplashscreen_imagepng)\n2. [Configure `res/values/colors.xml`](#-configure-resvaluescolorsxml)\n3. [Configure `res/drawable/splashscreen.xml`](#-configure-resdrawablesplashscreenxml)\n4. [Configure `res/values/styles.xml`](#-configure-resvaluesstylesxml)\n5. [Configure `AndroidManifest.xml`](#-configure-androidmanifestxml)\n6. [(<em>optional</em>) Customzine `resizeMode`](#-optional-customize-resizemode)\n7. [(<em>optional</em>) Enable dark mode](#-optional-enable-dark-mode-1)\n8. [(<em>optional</em>) Customize StatusBar](#-customize-statusbar-1)\n\n#### 🛠 Configure `res/drawable/splashscreen_image.png`\n\nYou have to provide your splash screen image and place it under the `res/drawable` directory.\nThis image will be loaded as soon as Android mounts your application's native view hierarchy.\n\n##### `NATIVE` mode adjustments\n\nIf you've overridden `<string name=\"expo_splash_screen_resize_mode\">native</string>` mode in [`res/values/strings.xml`](#-optional-customize-resizemode), you need to do a few additional steps.\n\nIn your application's `res` directory you might want to have a number of `drawable-X` sub-directories (where `X` is the different DPI for different devices). They store different versions of images that are picked based on the device's DPI (for more information please see [this official Android docs](https://developer.android.com/training/multiscreen/screendensities#TaskProvideAltBmp)).\n\nTo achieve proper scaling of your splash screen image on every device you should have following directories:\n\n- `res/drawable-mdpi` - scale 1x - resources for medium-density (mdpi) screens (~160dpi). (This is the baseline density.)\n- `res/drawable-hdpi` - scale 1.5x - resources for high-density (hdpi) screens (~240dpi).\n- `res/drawable-xhdpi` - scale 2x - resources for extra-high-density (xhdpi) screens (~320dpi).\n- `res/drawable-xxhdpi` - scale 3x - resources for extra-extra-high-density (xxhdpi) screens (~480dpi).\n- `res/drawable-xxxhdpi` - scale 4x - resources for extra-extra-extra-high-density (xxxhdpi) uses (~640dpi).\n\nEach of directories mentioned above should contain the same `splashscreen_image.png` file, but with a different resolution (pay attention to scale factors).\n\n#### 🛠 Configure `res/values/colors.xml`\n\nThis file contains colors that are reused across your application at the native level.\nUpdate the file with the following content or create one if missing:\n\n```diff\n<resources>\n+ <color name=\"splashscreen_background\">#AABBCC</color> <!-- #AARRGGBB or #RRGGBB format -->\n  <!-- Other colors defined for your application -->\n</resources>\n```\n\n#### 🛠 Configure `res/drawable/splashscreen.xml`\n\nThis file contains the description of how the splash screen view should be drawn by the Android system.\nCreate the file with the following content:\n\n```diff\n+ <layer-list xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\">\n+   <item android:drawable=\"@color/splashscreen_background\"/>\n+ </layer-list>\n```\n\n#### `NATIVE` mode adjustments\n\nIf you've overridden `<string name=\"expo_splash_screen_resize_mode\">native</string>` mode in [`res/values/strings.xml`](#-optional-customize-resizemode), you shoulw add:\n\n```diff\n<layer-list xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\">\n  <item android:drawable=\"@color/splashscreen_background\"/>\n+ <item>\n+   <bitmap android:gravity=\"center\" android:src=\"@drawable/splashscreen_image\"/>\n+ </item>\n</layer-list>\n```\n\n#### 🛠 Configure `res/values/styles.xml`\n\nLocate your main activity theme in `/android/app/src/res/values/styles.xml` or create one if missing.\n\n```diff\n  <!-- Main activity theme. -->\n  <style name=\"AppTheme\" parent=\"Theme.AppCompat.Light.NoActionBar\">\n+   <item name=\"android:windowBackground\">@drawable/splashscreen</item> <!-- this line instructs the system to use 'splashscreen.xml' as a background of the whole application -->\n    <!-- Other style properties -->\n  </style>\n```\n\n#### 🛠 Configure `AndroidManifest.xml`\n\nAdjust your application's main `AndroidManifest.xml` to contain an `android:theme` property pointing to the style that contains your splash screen configuration:\n\n```diff\n<manifest xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\"\n    package=\"com.example.myapp\">\n\n  ...\n\n  <application ...>\n\n+   <!-- Ensure that 'android:theme' property is pointing to the style containing native splash screen reference - see 'styles.xml' -->\n    <activity\n      android:name=\".MainActivity\"\n+     android:theme=\"@style/AppTheme\"\n      ...\n    >\n      ...\n    </activity>\n  </application>\n\n</manifest>\n```\n\n#### 🛠 (<em>optional</em>) Customize `resizeMode`\n\nThe default image [`resizeMode`](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/%40kudo/modularize-expo-splash-screen/packages/expo-splash-screen#built-in-splash-screen-image-resize-modes) is [`CONTAIN`](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/%40kudo/modularize-expo-splash-screen/packages/expo-splash-screen#contain-resize-mode). If you want to have different `resizeMode`, you need to override in `res/values/strings.xml`.\n\n```diff\n--- a/android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml\n+++ b/android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml\n <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" standalone=\"yes\"?>\n <resources>\n   <string name=\"app_name\">sdk42</string>\n+  <string name=\"expo_splash_screen_resize_mode\">contain|cover|native</string>\n</resources>\n```\n\n#### 🛠 (<em>optional</em>) Enable dark mode\n\n##### Provide different background colors - `res/values-night/colors.png`\n\nIf you want to have different background colors in your splash screen depending on the system color mode, you need to create a similar file to `colors.xml`, but in the directory `res/values-night`.\nValues in this file are going to picked by the system when it is switched to `dark` mode.\n\n```diff\n<resources>\n+ <color name=\"splashscreen_background\">#AABBCC</color> <!-- #AARRGGBB or #RRGGBB format -->\n</resources>\n```\n\n##### Provide different splash screen image - `res/drawable-night/splashscreen_image.png`\n\nYou might want to provide a separate splash screen image for dark mode usage, and place it under the `res/drawable-night` directory with exactly the same name as the normal one.\nThis step is optional, because you might want to have the same image in both `light` and `dark` modes (e.g. you have just a light-themed logo and you want to have different background colors in different modes).\n\n#### 🛠 (<em>optional</em>) Customize StatusBar\n\nYou might want to customize the StatusBar appearance during the time the SplashScreen is being shown.\n\n1. Customize `StatusBar hiding` flag\n\nTo have the StatusBar completely hidden you need to update your `res/values/styles.xml` file with the following entry (to prevent StatusBar from hiding either remove this entry or enter `false` as the value):\n\n```diff\n  <!-- Main/SplashScreen activity theme. -->\n  <style name=\"AppTheme\" parent=\"Theme.AppCompat.Light.NoActionBar\">\n    <item name=\"android:windowBackground\">@drawable/splashscreen</item>\n+   <item name=\"android:windowFullscreen\">true</item>\n    <!-- Other style properties -->\n  </style>\n```\n\nIf you have multiple `styles.xml` files located in different directories containing exactly the same `style` entry (e.g. in `res/values-night`, `res/values-night-v23`, etc.), be sure to update these files accordingly.\n\nRead more about `android:windowFullscreen` flag in [official Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr#windowFullscreen).\n\n2. Customize `StatusBar style` option\n\nThis option is only available for Android devices running Android 6.0 or greater.\nTo enforce `light` or `dark` StatusBar style for given system color mode, you have to prepare or update your `res/values-v23/styles.xml` file with the following entry (as of this option being supported since API 23, you have to configure specifically named directory containing separate configuration files):\n\n```diff\n  <!-- Main/SplashScreen activity theme. -->\n  <style name=\"AppTheme\" parent=\"Theme.AppCompat.Light.NoActionBar\">\n    <item name=\"android:windowBackground\">@drawable/splashscreen</item>\n+   <item name=\"android:windowLightStatusBar\">true|false</item>\n    <!-- Other style properties -->\n  </style>\n```\n\nAvailable values:\n\n- `true` for having dark-colored icons,\n- `false` for having light-colored icons.\n\nIf you have multiple `styles.xml` files located in different directories containing exactly the same `style` entry (e.g. in `res/values-night-v23` (for dark color mode), etc.), be sure to update these files accordingly.\n\nRead more about `android:windowLightStatusBar` flag in [official Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr#windowLightStatusBar).\n\nTo read more about Android multi-API-level support see [this official documentation](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/providing-resources).\n\n3. Customize `StatusBar color` option (a.k.a. `background color` of the StatusBar component)\n\nTo achieve custom background color you need to create a new color resource and provide it to the SplashScreen `style` description.\n\nCreate new color resource in your `res/values/colors.xml` (if your application supports dark mode, consider adding different color in `res/values-night/colors.xml` file):\n\n```diff\n  <resources>\n    <color name=\"splashscreen_background\">#D0D0C0</color>\n+   <color name=\"splashscreen_statusbar_color\">#(AA)RRGGBB</color> <!-- #AARRGGBB or #RRGGBB format -->\n  </resources>\n```\n\nUpdate your `res/values/styles.xml` file with the following entry:\n\n```diff\n  <!-- Main/SplashScreen activity theme. -->\n  <style name=\"AppTheme\" parent=\"Theme.AppCompat.Light.NoActionBar\">\n    <item name=\"android:windowBackground\">@drawable/splashscreen</item>\n+   <item name=\"android:statusBarColor\">@color/splashscreen_statusbar_color</item>\n    <!-- Other style properties -->\n  </style>\n```\n\nIf you have multiple `styles.xml` files located in different directories containing exactly the same `style` entry (e.g. in `res/values-night`, `res/values-night-v23`, etc.), be sure to update these files accordingly.\n\nRead more about `android:statusBarColor` option in [official Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr#statusBarColor).\n\n4. Customize `StatusBar translucent` flag\n\nWhen the StatusBar is translucent, the app will be able to draw under the StatusBar component area.\n\nTo make the StatusBar translucent update your `res/values/strings.xml` file with the following content:\n\n```diff\n--- a/android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml\n+++ b/android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml\n <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" standalone=\"yes\"?>\n <resources>\n   <string name=\"app_name\">sdk42</string>\n+  <string name=\"expo_splash_screen_status_bar_translucent\">true</string>\n</resources>\n```\n\n## 👏 Contributing\n\nContributions are very welcome! Please refer to guidelines described in the [contributing guide](https://github.com/expo/expo#contributing).\n\n## ❓ Known issues\n\n### iOS caching\n\nSplash Screens on iOS apps can sometimes encounter a caching issue where the previous image will flash before showing the new, intended image. When this occurs, we recommend you try power cycling your device and uninstalling and re-installing the application. However, the caching sometimes can persist for a day or two so be patient if the aforementioned steps were unable to resolve the issue.\n\n### `NATIVE` mode pushes splash image up a little bit\n\nSee [`NATIVE`](#native-resize-mode) mode preview above.\n\n> We are aware of this issue and unfortunately haven't been able to provide a solution as of yet. This is on our immediate roadmap...\n\n## ⬆️ Migrate from old versions\n\n### Migrate from expo-splash-screen < 0.12.0\n\nWe try to keep changes backward compatible, the code for `expo-splash-screen` will still work as it used to be. However, if you are going to migrate as new style API, here are the steps:\n\n1. Migrate your project from react-native-unimodules to expo-modules-core\n2. Remove expo-splash-screen code from MainActivity\n\n```diff\n--- a/android/app/src/main/java/com/helloworld/MainActivity.java\n+++ b/android/app/src/main/java/com/helloworld/MainActivity.java\n import com.facebook.react.ReactRootView;\n import com.swmansion.gesturehandler.react.RNGestureHandlerEnabledRootView;\n\n-import host.exp.exponent.experience.splashscreen.legacy.singletons.SplashScreen;\n-import host.exp.exponent.experience.splashscreen.legacy.SplashScreenImageResizeMode;\n-\n public class MainActivity extends ReactActivity {\n   @Override\n   protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n     // This is required for expo-splash-screen.\n     setTheme(R.style.AppTheme);\n     super.onCreate(null);\n-    // SplashScreen.show(...) has to be called after super.onCreate(...)\n-    SplashScreen.show(this, SplashScreenImageResizeMode.CONTAIN, ReactRootView.class, false);\n   }\n```\n\n3. Override default `resizeMode` and `statusBarTranslucent` in stings.xml\n\n```diff\n--- a/android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml\n+++ b/android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml\n <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" standalone=\"yes\"?>\n <resources>\n   <string name=\"app_name\">sdk42</string>\n+  <string name=\"expo_splash_screen_resize_mode\">contain</string>\n+  <string name=\"expo_splash_screen_status_bar_translucent\">false</string>\n</resources>\n```\n\n## 🏅 Hall Of Fame\n\nThis module is based on a solid work from (many thanks for that 👏):\n\n- [react-native-splash-screen](https://github.com/crazycodeboy/react-native-splash-screen)\n- [react-native-bootsplash](https://github.com/zoontek/react-native-bootsplash)\n- [react-native-make](https://github.com/bamlab/react-native-make)",

    "licenseText": "# The flow-parser package\n\nThis package contains the Flow parser in its compiled-to-JavaScript form.\n\n# What is Flow\n\nSee [flow.org](https://flow.org/). The code for the Flow parser [lives on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/flow/tree/master/src/parser).\n\n# What is the Flow Parser\n\nThe Flow Parser is a JavaScript parser written in OCaml. It produces an AST that conforms to the [ESTree spec](https://github.com/estree/estree) and that mostly matches what [esprima](http://esprima.org/) produces. The Flow Parser can be compiled to native code or can be compiled to JavaScript using [js_of_ocaml](http://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml/). This npm package contains the Flow parser compiled to JavaScript.\n\n# Usage\n\nYou can use the Flow parser in your browser or in node. To use in node you can just do\n\n```JavaScript\nrequire('flow-parser').parse('1+1', {});\n```\n\nTo use in the browser, you can add\n\n```HTML\n<script src=\"flow_parser.js\"></script>\n```\n\nwhich will make the `flow` object available to use like so:\n\n```JavaScript\nflow.parse('1+1', {});\n```\n\n## Options\n\nThe second argument to `flow.parse` is the options object. Currently supported options:\n\n* `all_comments` (boolean, default `true`) - include a list of all comments from the whole program\n* `comments` (boolean, default `true`) - attach comments to AST nodes (`leadingComments` and `trailingComments`)\n* `enums` (boolean, default `false`) - enable parsing of Flow enums\n* `esproposal_decorators` (boolean, default `false`) - enable parsing of decorators\n* `esproposal_export_star_as` (boolean, default `false`) - enable parsing of `export * as` syntax\n* `tokens` (boolean, default `false`) - include a list of all parsed tokens in a top-level `tokens` property\n* `types` (boolean, default `true`) - enable parsing of Flow types\n* `use_strict` (boolean, default `false`) - treat the file as strict, without needing a \"use strict\" directive",

This is achieved by using the [HTTP `CONNECT` method][CONNECT].\n\nThe `options` argument may either be a string URI of the proxy server to use, or an\n\"options\" object with more specific properties:\n\n  * `host` - String - Proxy host to connect to (may use `hostname` as well). Required.\n  * `port` - Number - Proxy port to connect to. Required.\n  * `protocol` - String - If `https:`, then use TLS to connect to the proxy.\n  * `headers` - Object - Additional HTTP headers to be sent on the HTTP CONNECT method.\n  * Any other options given are passed to the `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()` functions.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\n[CONNECT]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_tunnel#HTTP_CONNECT_Tunneling",

    "licenseText": "iMurmurHash.js\n==============\n\nAn incremental implementation of the MurmurHash3 (32-bit) hashing algorithm for JavaScript based on [Gary Court's implementation](https://github.com/garycourt/murmurhash-js) with [kazuyukitanimura's modifications](https://github.com/kazuyukitanimura/murmurhash-js).\n\nThis version works significantly faster than the non-incremental version if you need to hash many small strings into a single hash, since string concatenation (to build the single string to pass the non-incremental version) is fairly costly. In one case tested, using the incremental version was about 50% faster than concatenating 5-10 strings and then hashing.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nTo use iMurmurHash in the browser, [download the latest version](https://raw.github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js/master/imurmurhash.min.js) and include it as a script on your site.\n\n```html\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/scripts/imurmurhash.min.js\"></script>\n<script>\n// Your code here, access iMurmurHash using the global object MurmurHash3\n</script>\n```\n\n---\n\nTo use iMurmurHash in Node.js, install the module using NPM:\n\n```bash\nnpm install imurmurhash\n```\n\nThen simply include it in your scripts:\n\n```javascript\nMurmurHash3 = require('imurmurhash');\n```\n\nQuick Example\n-------------\n\n```javascript\n// Create the initial hash\nvar hashState = MurmurHash3('string');\n\n// Incrementally add text\nhashState.hash('more strings');\nhashState.hash('even more strings');\n\n// All calls can be chained if desired\nhashState.hash('and').hash('some').hash('more');\n\n// Get a result\nhashState.result();\n// returns 0xe4ccfe6b\n```\n\nFunctions\n---------\n\n### MurmurHash3 ([string], [seed])\nGet a hash state object, optionally initialized with the given _string_ and _seed_. _Seed_ must be a positive integer if provided. Calling this function without the `new` keyword will return a cached state object that has been reset. This is safe to use as long as the object is only used from a single thread and no other hashes are created while operating on this one. If this constraint cannot be met, you can use `new` to create a new state object. For example:\n\n```javascript\n// Use the cached object, calling the function again will return the same\n// object (but reset, so the current state would be lost)\nhashState = MurmurHash3();\n...\n\n// Create a new object that can be safely used however you wish. Calling the\n// function again will simply return a new state object, and no state loss\n// will occur, at the cost of creating more objects.\nhashState = new MurmurHash3();\n```\n\nBoth methods can be mixed however you like if you have different use cases.\n\n---\n\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.hash (string)\nIncrementally add _string_ to the hash. This can be called as many times as you want for the hash state object, including after a call to `result()`. Returns `this` so calls can be chained.\n\n---\n\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.result ()\nGet the result of the hash as a 32-bit positive integer. This performs the tail and finalizer portions of the algorithm, but does not store the result in the state object. This means that it is perfectly safe to get results and then continue adding strings via `hash`.\n\n```javascript\n// Do the whole string at once\nMurmurHash3('this is a test string').result();\n// 0x70529328\n\n// Do part of the string, get a result, then the other part\nvar m = MurmurHash3('this is a');\nm.result();\n// 0xbfc4f834\nm.hash(' test string').result();\n// 0x70529328 (same as above)\n```\n\n---\n\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.reset ([seed])\nReset the state object for reuse, optionally using the given _seed_ (defaults to 0 like the constructor). Returns `this` so calls can be chained.\n\n---\n\nLicense (MIT)\n-------------\nCopyright (c) 2013 Gary Court, Jens Taylor\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Litigation\n-------------\n\nAny litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the\ncourts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal\nplace of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that\njurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.\nNothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring\ncross-claims or counter-claims.\n\n9. Miscellaneous\n----------------\n\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject\nmatter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\nunenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\nnecessary to make it enforceable.

Except as provided in Section\n10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or\npublish new versions of this License.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.\n\n    While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose\n    to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty,\n    indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with\n    this License.

These owners may\ncontribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the\nfurther production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain\nreputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and\nefforts of others.\n\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation\nof additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a\nWork (the \"Affirmer\"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright\nand Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work\nand publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her\nCopyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal\neffect of CC0 on those rights.\n\n1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be\nprotected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (\"Copyright and\nRelated Rights\"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited\nto, the following:\n\n  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,\n  and translate a Work;\n\n  ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\n\n  iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness\n  depicted in a Work;\n\n  iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\n  subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;\n\n  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in\n  a Work;\n\n  vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the\n  European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\n  protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,\n  including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\n\n  vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world\n  based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.\n\n2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,\napplicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and\nunconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright\nand Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now\nknown or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of\naction), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum\nduration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\nextensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\ncopies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\ncommercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \"Waiver\"). Affirmer makes\nthe Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the\ndetriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver\nshall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or\nany other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work\nby the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n\n3. Public License Fallback.

Any of\nthe following should work, depending on your project configuration:\n\n* [babel runtime transform plugin]\n* [babel polyfill]\n* https://github.com/medikoo/es6-iterator\n* https://github.com/zloirock/core-js\n\n\n## Examples\n\n### Create\n\nCreate a date range:\n\n``` js\nconst start = new Date(2012, 0, 15);\nconst end   = new Date(2012, 4, 23);\nconst range = moment.range(start, end);\n```\n\nYou can also create a date range with moment objects:\n\n``` js\nconst start = moment('2011-04-15', 'YYYY-MM-DD');\nconst end   = moment('2011-11-27', 'YYYY-MM-DD');\nconst range = moment.range(start, end);\n```\n\nArrays work too:\n\n``` js\nconst dates = [moment('2011-04-15', 'YYYY-MM-DD'), moment('2011-11-27', 'YYYY-MM-DD')];\nconst range = moment.range(dates);\n```\n\nYou can also create a range from an [ISO 8601 time interval][interval] string:\n\n``` js\nconst timeInterval = '2015-01-17T09:50:04+00:00/2015-04-17T08:29:55+00:00';\nconst range = moment.range(timeInterval);\n```\n\nYou can also create a range from the start until the end of a named interval:\n\n``` js\nconst date = moment('2011-04-15', 'YYYY-MM-DD');\nconst range = date.range('month');\n```\n\nYou can also create open-ended ranges which go to the earliest or latest possible date:\n\n``` js\nconst rangeUntil = moment.range(null, '2011-05-05');\nconst rangeFrom = moment.range('2011-03-05');\nconst rangeAllTime = moment.range();\n```\nNote that any falsy value except 0 is treated as a missing date, resulting in an open-ended range.\n\n*Note:* Dates and moment objects both use a timestamp of 00:00:000 if none is\nprovided. To ensure your range includes any timestamp for the given end date,\nuse `.setHours(23,59,59,999)` when constructing a Date object, or\n`.endOf('day')` when constructing a moment object.\n\n#### rangeFromInterval\n\nYou can also create a range between an interval and a specified date. This accepts positive or negative values\nfor `count` and the date will default to _now_ if not provided.\n\n``` js\nconst interval = 'month';\nconst count = 4;\nconst date = moment('2017-07-20');\n\nconst range1 = moment.rangeFromInterval(interval, count, date);  // moment.range('2017-07-20', '2017-11-20')\nconst range2 = moment.rangeFromInterval('month', -2, date);      // moment.range('2017-05-20', '2017-07-20')\n```\n\nNote: The date can be provided as a Date, String, or Moment.\nWhen using a negative interval, the date provided will be set as the end of the range.\n\n#### parseZoneRange\n\n**DEPRECATED** in `4.0.0`: Replaced by `rangeFromISOString` to follow naming conventions.\n\n#### rangeFromISOString\n\nConverts an [ISO 8601 time interval string][interval] into a date range while\npreserving the time zones using [moment.parseZone][parseZone].\n\n``` js\nconst interval = '2015-01-17T09:50:00+03:00/2015-04-17T08:29:55-04:00';\nconst range = moment.rangeFromISOString(interval);\n\nrange.toString(); // '2015-01-17T09:50:00+03:00/2015-04-17T08:29:55-04:00'\n```\n\n### Attributes\n\nYou can access the start and end moments of the range easily enough:\n\n``` js\nconst start = new Date(2012, 0, 15);\nconst end   = new Date(2012, 4, 23);\nconst range = moment.range(start, end);\n\nrange.start  // moment\nrange.end  // moment\n```\n\n### Querying\n\nMany of the following examples make use of these moments:\n\n``` js\nconst a = moment('2016-03-10');\nconst b = moment('2016-03-15');\nconst c = moment('2016-03-29');\nconst d = moment('2016-04-01');\n```\n\n#### Adjacent\n\nCheck if two ranges are touching but not overlapping:\n\n``` js\n\nconst range1 = moment.range(a, b);\nconst range2 = moment.range(b, c);\nconst range3 = moment.range(c, d);\n\nrange1.adjacent(range2) // true\nrange1.adjacent(range3) // false\n```\n\n#### Center\n\nCalculate the center of a range:\n\n``` js\nconst start = new Date(2011, 2, 5);\nconst end   = new Date(2011, 3, 5);\nconst range = moment.range(start, end);\n\nrange.center(); // 1300622400000\n```\n\n#### Contains\n\nCheck to see if your range contains a date/moment. By default the start and end\ndates are included in the search. E.g.:\n\n``` js\nconst range = moment.range(a, c);\n\nrange.contains(a); // true\nrange.contains(b); // true\nrange.contains(c); // true\nrange.contains(d); // false\n```\n\nYou can also control whether the start or end dates should be excluded from the\nsearch with the `excludeStart` and `excludeEnd` options:\n\n``` js\nconst range = moment.range(a, c);\n\nrange.contains(a); // true\nrange.contains(a, { excludeStart: true }); // false\nrange.contains(c); // true\nrange.contains(c, { excludeEnd: true; }); // false\n```\n\n**DEPRECATED** in `4.0.0`: The `exclusive` options is used to indicate if the start/end of\nthe range should be excluded when testing for inclusion:\n\n**Note**: You can obtain the same functionality by setting `{ excludeStart:\ntrue, excludeEnd: true }`\n\n``` js\nrange.contains(c); // true\nrange.contains(c, { exclusive: false }); // true\nrange.contains(c, { exclusive: true }); // false\n```\n\n#### Within\n\nFind out if your moment falls within a date range:\n\n``` js\nconst range = moment.range(a, c);\n\nb.within(range); // true\n```\n\n#### Overlaps\n\nDoes it overlap another range?\n\n``` js\nconst range1 = moment.range(a, c);\nconst range2 = moment.range(b, d);\nrange1.overlaps(range2); // true\n```\n\nInclude adjacent ranges:\n\n``` js\nconst range1 = moment.range(a, b);\nconst range2 = moment.range(b, c);\n\nrange1.overlaps(range2)                      // false\nrange1.overlaps(range2, { adjacent: false }) // false\nrange1.overlaps(range2, { adjacent: true })  // true\n```\n\n#### Intersect\n\nWhat is the intersecting range?\n\n``` js\nconst range1 = moment.range(a, c);\nconst range2 = moment.range(b, d);\nrange1.intersect(range2); // moment.range(b, c)\n```\n\n#### IsRange\n\nIs it a Range?\n\n``` js\nmoment.isRange(range); // true\nmoment.isRange(IamNotRange); // false\n```\n\n### Manipulation\n\n#### Add\n\nAdd/combine/merge overlapping or adjacent ranges.\n\n``` js\nconst range1 = moment.range(a, c);\nconst range2 = moment.range(b, d);\nrange1.add(range2); // moment.range(a, d)\n\nconst range3 = moment.range(a, b);\nconst range4 = moment.range(c, d);\nrange3.add(range4); // null\n```\n\nInclude adjacent ranges:\n\n``` js\nconst range1 = moment.range(a, b);\nconst range2 = moment.range(b, c);\n\nrange1.add(range2); // null\nrange1.add(range2, { adjacent: false }); // null\nrange1.add(range2, { adjacent: true }); // moment.range(a, c)\n```\n\n#### Clone\n\nDeep clone a range\n\n``` js\nconst range1 = moment.range(a, d);\n\nconst range2 = range1.clone();\nrange2.start.add(2, 'days');\n\nrange1.start.toDate().getTime() === range2.start.toDate().getTime() // false\n```\n\n#### SnapTo\n\nSnap the start and end of a range to a given interval.\n\n``` js\nconst start = moment('2018-01-25 17:05:33');\nconst end = moment('2018-01-28 06:10:00');\n\nconst range1 = moment.range(start, end);\nconst range2 = range1.snapTo('day'); // 2018-01-25T00:00:00 -> 2018-01-28T23:59:59\n\nrange1.diff('days'); // 2\nrange2.diff('days'); // 3\n```\n\n#### Subtract\n\nSubtracting one range from another.\n\n``` js\nconst range_ab = moment.range(a, b);\nconst range_bc = moment.range(b, c);\nconst range_cd = moment.range(c, d);\nconst range_ad = moment.range(a, d);\nrange_ad.subtract(range_bc); // [moment.range(a, b) moment.range(c, d)]\nrange_ac.subtract(range_bc); // [moment.range(a, b)]\nrange_ab.subtract(range_cd); // [moment.range(a, b)]\nrange_bc.subtract(range_bd); // [null]\n```\n\n### Iteration\n\nEach of the iteration methods returns an [Iterable][iterable], providing\na convenient and performant interface to iterating over your ranges by a given\nperiod.\n\n#### by\n\nIterate over your range by a given period. Any of the units accepted by\n[moment.js' `add` method][add] may be used. E.g.: `'years' | 'quarters'\n| 'months' | 'weeks' | 'days' | 'hours' | 'minutes' | 'seconds'\n| 'milliseconds'`\n\n``` js\nconst range = moment.range('2010-01-01', '2015-01-01');\n\nfor (let month of range.by('month')) {\n  month.format('YYYY-MM-DD');\n}\n\nconst years = Array.from(range.by('year'));\nyears.length == 6 // true\nyears.map(m => m.format('YYYY')) // ['2010', '2011', '2012', '2013', '2014', '2015']\n```\n\nIteration also supports excluding the final time slice of the range by setting the\n`excludeEnd` option to `true`. In the example below, the 5:00 -> 6:00 time slice is omitted.\n\n``` js\nconst range = moment.range('2018-01-01 00:00', '2018-01-01 05:30');\n\nconst hours = Array.from(range.by('hour', { excludeEnd: true }));\nhours.length == 5 // true\nhours.map(m => m.format('HH:mm')) // ['00:00', '01:00', '02:00', '03:00', '04:00']\n```\n\nAdditionally it's possible to iterate by a given step that defaults to `1`:\n\n``` js\nconst start  = new Date(2012, 2, 2);\nconst end    = new Date(2012, 2, 6);\nconst range1 = moment.range(start, end);\n\nlet acc = Array.from(range1.by('day', { step: 2 }));\n\nacc.map(m => m.format('DD')) // ['02', '04', '06']\n\nacc = Array.from(range1.by('day', { excludeEnd: true, step: 2 }));\n\nacc.map(m => m.format('DD')) // ['02', '04']\n```\n\nYou can iterate over the span of a range for a period that is entered but not complete by using the [snapTo()](#snapto) method:\n\n``` js\nconst start = moment(\"2017-01-01T13:30:00\");\nconst end = moment(\"2017-01-05T01:45:12\");\nconst r1 = moment.range(start, end);\nconst r2 = r1.snapTo('day');\n\nArray.from(r1.by('days')).map(m => m.format('DD')); // ['01', '02', '03', '04']\nArray.from(r2.by('days')).map(m => m.format('DD')); // ['01', '02', '03', '04', '05']\n```\n\n**DEPRECATED** in `4.0.0`: The `exclusive` options is used to indicate if the\nend of the range should be excluded when testing for inclusion:\n\n**Note**: You can obtain the same functionality by setting `{ excludeEnd: true }`\n\n\n#### byRange\n\n``` js\nconst start = new Date(2012, 2, 1); // 1st\nconst two   = new Date(2012, 2, 2); // 2nd\nconst end   = new Date(2012, 2, 5); // 5th\nconst range1 = moment.range(start, end);\nconst range2 = moment.range(start, two); // One day\n```\n\nIterate by another range:\n\n``` js\nconst acc = Array.from(range1.byRange(range2));\n\nacc.length == 5 // true\nacc.map(m => m.format('DD')) // ['01','02','03','04','05']\n```\n\nExclude the end time slice:\n\n``` js\nconst acc = Array.from(range1.byRange(range2, { excludeEnd: true }));\n\nacc.length == 4 // true\nacc.map(m => m.format('DD')) // ['01','02','03','04']\n```\n\nBy step:\n\n``` js\nlet acc = Array.from(range1.byRange(range2, { step: 2 }));\n\nacc.map(m => m.format('DD')) // ['01', '03', '05']\n\nacc = Array.from(range1.byRange(range2, { excludeEnd, true, step: 2 }));\n\nacc.map(m => m.format('DD')) // ['01', '03']\n```\n\n**DEPRECATED** in `4.0.0`: The `exclusive` options is used to indicate if the\nend of the range should be excluded when testing for inclusion:\n\n**Note**: You can obtain the same functionality by setting `{ excludeEnd: true }`\n\n\n#### reverseBy\n\nIterate over a range in reverse:\n\n``` js\nconst range = moment.range('2012-01-01', '2015-01-01');\nconst acc = Array.from(range.reverseBy('years'));\nacc.map(m => m.format('YYYY')) // ['2015', '2014', '2013', '2012']\n```\n\nExclude the start time slice:\n\n``` js\nconst range = moment.range('2012-01-01', '2015-01-01');\nconst acc = Array.from(range.reverseBy('years', { excludeStart: true }));\nacc.map(m => m.format('YYYY')) // ['2015', '2014', '2013']\n```\n\nBy step:\n\n``` js\nconst start  = new Date(2012, 2, 2);\nconst end    = new Date(2012, 2, 6);\nconst range1 = moment.range(start, end);\n\nlet acc = Array.from(range1.reverseBy('day', { step: 2 }));\n\nacc.map(m => m.format('DD')) // ['06', '04', '02']\n\nacc = Array.from(range1.reverseBy('day', { excludeStart: true, step: 2 }));\n\nacc.map(m => m.format('DD')) // ['06', '04']\n```\n\n**DEPRECATED** in `4.0.0`: The `exclusive` options is used to indicate if the\nstart of the range should be excluded when testing for inclusion:\n\n**Note**: You can obtain the same functionality by setting `{ excludeStart: true }`\n\n\n#### reverseByRange\n\n``` js\nconst start = new Date(2012, 2, 1);\nconst two   = new Date(2012, 2, 2);\nconst end   = new Date(2012, 2, 5);\nconst range1 = moment.range(start, end);\nconst range2 = moment.range(start, two); // One day\n```\n\nIterate by another range in reverse:\n\n``` js\nconst acc = Array.from(range1.reverseByRange(range2));\n\nacc.length == 5 // true\nacc.map(m => m.format('DD')) // ['05', '04', '03', '02', '01']\n```\n\nExclude the start value:\n\n``` js\nconst acc = Array.from(range1.reverseByRange(range2, { excludeStart: true }));\n\nacc.length == 4 // true\nacc.map(m => m.format('DD')) // ['05', '04', '03', '02']\n```\n\nBy step:\n\n``` js\nlet acc = Array.from(range1.reverseByRange(range2, { step: 2 }));\n\nacc.map(m => m.format('DD')) // ['05', '03', '01']\n\nacc = Array.from(range1.reverseByRange(range2, { excludeStart: true, step: 2 }));\n\nacc.map(m => m.format('DD')) // ['05', '03']\n```\n\n**DEPRECATED** in `4.0.0`: The `exclusive` options is used to indicate if the\nstart of the range should be excluded when testing for inclusion:\n\n**Note**: You can obtain the same functionality by setting `{ excludeStart: true }`\n\n\n### Compare\n\nCompare range lengths or add them together with simple math:\n\n``` js\nconst range1 = moment.range(new Date(2011, 2, 5), new Date(2011, 3, 15));\nconst range2 = moment.range(new Date(1995, 0, 1), new Date(1995, 12, 25));\n\nrange2 > range1 // true\n\nrange1 + range2 // duration of both ranges in milliseconds\n\nMath.abs(range1 - range2); // difference of ranges in milliseconds\n```\n\n#### Equality\n\nCheck if two ranges are the same, i.e. their starts and ends are the same:\n\n``` js\nconst range1 = moment.range(new Date(2011, 2, 5), new Date(2011, 3, 15));\nconst range2 = moment.range(new Date(2011, 2, 5), new Date(2011, 3, 15));\nconst range3 = moment.range(new Date(2011, 3, 5), new Date(2011, 6, 15));\n\nrange1.isSame(range2); // true\nrange2.isSame(range3); // false\n\nrange1.isEqual(range2); // true\nrange2.isEqual(range3); // false\n```\n\n#### Difference\n\nThe difference of the entire range given various units.\n\nAny of the units accepted by [moment.js' `add` method][add] may be used.\n\n``` js\nconst start = new Date(2011, 2, 5);\nconst end   = new Date(2011, 5, 5);\nconst range = moment.range(start, end);\n\nrange.diff('months'); // 3\nrange.diff('days');   // 92\nrange.diff();         // 7945200000\n```\n\nOptionally you may specify if the difference should not be truncated. By default it\nmimics moment-js' behaviour and truncates the values:\n\n``` js\nconst d1 = new Date(Date.UTC(2011, 4, 1));\nconst d2 = new Date(Date.UTC(2011, 4, 5, 12));\nconst range = moment.range(d1, d2);\n\nrange.diff('days')        // 4\nrange.diff('days', false) // 4\nrange.diff('days', true)  // 4.75\n```\n\n`#duration` is an alias for `#diff` and they may be used interchangeably.\n\n### Conversion\n\n#### `toDate`\n\nConverts the `DateRange` to an `Array` of the start and end `Date` objects.\n\n``` js\nconst start = new Date(2011, 2, 5);\nconst end   = new Date(2011, 5, 5);\nconst range = moment.range(start, end);\n\nrange.toDate(); // [new Date(2011, 2, 5), new Date(2011, 5, 5)]\n```\n\n#### `toString`\n\nConverting a `DateRange` to a `String` will format it as an [ISO 8601 time\ninterval][interval]:\n\n``` js\nconst start = '2015-01-17T09:50:04+00:00';\nconst end   = '2015-04-17T08:29:55+00:00';\nconst range = moment.range(moment.utc(start), moment.utc(end));\n\nrange.toString() // '2015-01-17T09:50:04+00:00/2015-04-17T08:29:55+00:00'\n```\n\n#### `valueOf`\n\nThe difference between the end date and start date in milliseconds.\n\n``` js\nconst start = new Date(2011, 2, 5);\nconst end   = new Date(2011, 5, 5);\nconst range = moment.range(start, end);\n\nrange.valueOf(); // 7945200000\n```\n\n## Running Tests\n\nClone this bad boy:\n\n``` sh\ngit clone https://git@github.com/rotaready/moment-range.git\n```\n\nInstall the dependencies:\n\n``` sh\nyarn install\n```\n\nDo all the things!\n\n``` sh\nyarn run check\nyarn run test\nyarn run lint\n```\n\n## Contributors\n\n- [**Adam Biggs**](https://github.com/adambiggs) (http://lightmaker.com)\n- [**Mats Julian Olsen**](https://github.com/mewwts)\n- [**Matt Patterson**](https://github.com/fidothe) (http://reprocessed.org/)\n- [**Wilgert Velinga**](https://github.com/wilgert) (http://neocles.io)\n- [**Tomasz Bak**](https://github.com/tb) (http://twitter.com/tomaszbak)\n- [**Stuart Kelly**](https://github.com/stuartleigh)\n- [**Jeremy Forsythe**](https://github.com/jdforsythe)\n- [**Александр Гренишин**](https://github.com/nd0ut)\n- [**@scotthovestadt**](https://github.com/scotthovestadt)\n- [**Thomas van Lankveld**](https://github.com/thomasvanlankveld)\n- [**nebel**](https://github.com/pronebel)\n- [**Kevin Ross**](https://github.com/rosskevin) (http://www.alienfast.com)\n- [**Thomas Walpole**](https://github.com/twalpole)\n- [**Jonathan Kim**](https://github.com/jkimbo) (http://jkimbo.co.uk)\n- [**Tymon Tobolski**](https://github.com/teamon) (http://teamon.eu)\n- [**Aristide Niyungeko**](https://github.com/aristiden7o)\n- [**Bradley Ayers**](https://github.com/bradleyayers)\n- [**Ross Hadden**](https://github.com/rosshadden) (http://rosshadden.github.com/resume)\n- [**Victoria French**](https://github.com/victoriafrench)\n- [**Jochen Diekenbrock**](https://github.com/JochenDiekenbrock)\n\n\n## License\n\nmoment-range is [UNLICENSED][unlicense].\n\n[add]: http://momentjs.com/docs/#/manipulating/add/\n[babel runtime transform plugin]: https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-runtime\n[babel polyfill]: https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/polyfill\n[broad support]: http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/#test-well-known_symbols_Symbol.iterator,_existence_a_href=_https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol/iterator_title=_MDN_documentation_img_src=_../mdn.png_alt=_MDN_(Mozilla_Development_Network)_logo_width=_15_height=_13_/_/a_nbsp;\n[cdnjs]: https://github.com/cdnjs/cdnjs\n[cdnjs-moment-range]: https://cdnjs.com/libraries/moment-range\n[interval]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Time_intervals\n[iterable]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols#Syntaxes_expecting_iterables\n[iteration protocols]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols\n[moment]: http://momentjs.com/\n[node]: http://nodejs.org/\n[unlicense]: http://unlicense.org/\n[parseZone]: https://momentjs.com/docs/#/parsing/parse-zone/",

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n          NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.",

  "react-devtools-core@5.3.2": {
    "licenses": "MIT",
    "repository": "https://github.com/facebook/react",
    "licenseText": "# `react-devtools-core`\n\nThis package provides low-level APIs to support renderers like [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native). If you're looking for the standalone React DevTools UI, **we suggest using [`react-devtools`](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/main/packages/react-devtools) instead of using this package directly**.\n\nThis package provides two entrypoints: labeled \"backend\" and \"standalone\" (frontend). Both APIs are described below.\n\n# Backend API\n\nBackend APIs are embedded in _development_ builds of renderers like [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) in order to connect to the React DevTools UI.\n\n### Example\n\nIf you are building a non-browser-based React renderer, you can use the backend API like so:\n\n```js\nif (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {\n  const { connectToDevTools } = require(\"react-devtools-core\");\n\n  // Must be called before packages like react or react-native are imported\n  connectToDevTools({\n    ...config\n  });\n}\n```\n\n> **NOTE** that this API (`connectToDevTools`) must be (1) run in the same context as React and (2) must be called before React packages are imported (e.g. `react`, `react-dom`, `react-native`).\n\n### `connectToDevTools` options\n| Prop | Default | Description |\n|---|---|---|\n| `host` | `\"localhost\"` | Socket connection to frontend should use this host. |\n| `isAppActive` |  | (Optional) function that returns true/false, telling DevTools when it's ready to connect to React. |\n| `port` | `8097` | Socket connection to frontend should use this port. |\n| `resolveRNStyle` |  | (Optional) function that accepts a key (number) and returns a style (object); used by React Native. |\n| `retryConnectionDelay` | `200` | Delay (ms) to wait between retrying a failed Websocket connection |\n| `useHttps` | `false` | Socket connection to frontend should use secure protocol (wss). |\n| `websocket` |  | Custom `WebSocket` connection to frontend; overrides `host` and `port` settings. |\n\n\n### `connectWithCustomMessagingProtocol` options\n| Prop            | Description                                                                                                                                                    |\n|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `onSubscribe`   | Function, which receives listener (function, with a single argument) as an argument. Called when backend subscribes to messages from the other end (frontend). |\n| `onUnsubscribe` | Function, which receives listener (function) as an argument. Called when backend unsubscribes to messages from the other end (frontend).                       |\n| `onMessage`     | Function, which receives 2 arguments: event (string) and payload (any). Called when backend emits a message, which should be sent to the frontend.             |\n\nUnlike `connectToDevTools`, `connectWithCustomMessagingProtocol` returns a callback, which can be used for unsubscribing the backend from the global DevTools hook.\n\n# Frontend API\n\nFrontend APIs can be used to render the DevTools UI into a DOM node. One example of this is [`react-devtools`](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/main/packages/react-devtools) which wraps DevTools in an Electron app.\n\n### Example\n```js\nimport DevtoolsUI from \"react-devtools-core/standalone\";\n\n// See the full list of API methods in documentation below.\nconst { setContentDOMNode, startServer } = DevtoolsUI;\n\n// Render DevTools UI into a DOM element.\nsetContentDOMNode(document.getElementById(\"container\"));\n\n// Start socket server used to communicate between backend and frontend.\nstartServer(\n  // Port defaults to 8097\n  1234,\n\n  // Host defaults to \"localhost\"\n  \"example.devserver.com\",\n\n  // Optional config for secure socket (WSS).\n  {\n    key: fs.readFileSync('test/fixtures/keys/agent2-key.pem'),\n    cert: fs.readFileSync('test/fixtures/keys/agent2-cert.pem')\n  }\n);\n```\n\n### Exported methods\nThe `default` export is an object defining the methods described below.\n\nThese methods support chaining for convenience. For example:\n```js\nconst DevtoolsUI = require(\"react-devtools-core/standalone\");\nDevtoolsUI.setContentDOMNode(element).startServer();\n```\n\n#### `connectToSocket(socket: WebSocket)`\n> This is an advanced config function that is typically not used.\n\nCustom `WebSocket` connection to use for communication between DevTools frontend and backend. Calling this method automatically initializes the DevTools UI (similar to calling `startServer()`).\n\n#### `openProfiler()`\nAutomatically select the \"Profiler\" tab in the DevTools UI.\n\n#### `setContentDOMNode(element: HTMLElement)`\nSet the DOM element DevTools UI should be rendered into on initialization.\n\n#### `setDisconnectedCallback(callback: Function)`\n_Optional_ callback to be notified when DevTools `WebSocket` closes (or errors).\n\n#### `setProjectRoots(roots: Array<string>)`\n_Optional_ set of root directories for source files. These roots can be used to open an inspected component's source code using an IDE.\n\n#### `setStatusListener(callback: Function)`\n_Optional_ callback to be notified of socket server events (e.g. initialized, errored, connected).\n\nThis callback receives two parameters:\n```js\nfunction onStatus(\n  message: string,\n  status: 'server-connected' | 'devtools-connected' | 'error'\n): void {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n#### `startServer(port?: number, host?: string, httpsOptions?: Object, loggerOptions?: Object)`\nStart a socket server (used to communicate between backend and frontend) and renders the DevTools UI.\n\nThis method accepts the following parameters:\n| Name | Default | Description |\n|---|---|---|\n| `port` | `8097` | Socket connection to backend should use this port. |\n| `host` | `\"localhost\"` | Socket connection to backend should use this host. |\n| `httpsOptions` | | _Optional_ object defining `key` and `cert` strings. |\n| `loggerOptions` | | _Optional_ object defining a `surface` string (to be included with DevTools logging events). |\n\n# Development\n\nWatch for changes made to the backend entry point and rebuild:\n```sh\nyarn start:backend\n```\n\nWatch for changes made to the standalone UI entry point and rebuild:\n```sh\nyarn start:standalone\n```\n\nRun the standalone UI using `yarn start` in the [`react-devtools`](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/main/packages/react-devtools).",

Please use linebyline instead, it is the same module just renamed:\n[Npm linebyline](https://www.npmjs.com/package/linebyline)\n\n```sh\nnpm install linebyline\n```\n\n## Test\n```sh\nnpm install .\nnpm test\n\n```\n\n\n## What's this?\n\nSimple streaming readline module for NodeJS. Reads a file and buffers new lines emitting a _line_ event for each line.\n\n## Usage\n### Simple\n```js\n  var readline = require('linebyline'),\n      rl = readline('./somefile.txt');\n  rl.on('line', function(line, lineCount, byteCount) {\n    // do something with the line of text\n  })\n  .on('error', function(e) {\n    // something went wrong\n  });\n```\n\n### ASCII file decoding\nAs the underlying `fs.createReadStream` doesn't care about the specific ASCII encoding of the file, an alternative way to decode the file is by telling the `readline` library to retain buffer and then decoding it using a converter (e.g. [`iconv-lite`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/iconv-lite)).\n```js\n  var readline = require('linebyline'),\n      rl = readline('./file-in-win1251.txt', {\n    retainBuffer: true //tell readline to retain buffer \n  });\n  rl.on(\"line\", function (data,linecount){\n    var line = iconv.decode(data, 'win1251');\n    // do something with the line of converted text\n  });\n```\n##API\n## readLine(readingObject[, options])\n### Params:\n\n* `readingObject` - file path or stream object\n* `options` can include:\n  * `maxLineLength` - override the default 4K buffer size (lines longer than this will not be read)\n  * `retainBuffer` - avoid converting to String prior to emitting 'line' event; will pass raw buffer with encoded data to the callback\n\n### Return:\n\n* **EventEmitter** \n\n\n## License\n\nBSD © [Craig Brookes](http://craigbrookes.com/)",

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License.

    "licenseText": "GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                       Version 3, 29 June 2007\n\n Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\nsoftware and other kinds of works.\n\n  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\nto take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html>.",

Useful for test code, debugging, and a wide range of other utilities.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n[![NPM][badge-npm-img]][badge-npm-url]\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nTo use the stream buffers in your module, simply import it and away you go.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar streamBuffers = require(\"stream-buffers\");\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Writable StreamBuffer\r\n\r\nWritable Stream Buffers implement the standardized writable stream interface. All write()'s to this object will accumulate in an internal Buffer. If the Buffer overflows it will be resized larger automatically. The initial size of the Buffer and the amount in which it grows can be configured in the constructor.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar myWritableStreamBuffer = new streamBuffers.WritableStreamBuffer({\r\n\tinitialSize: (100 * 1024),\t\t// start as 100 kilobytes.\r\n\tincrementAmount: (10 * 1024)\t// grow by 10 kilobytes each time buffer overflows.\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe default initial size and increment amount are stored in the following constants:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nstreamBuffers.DEFAULT_INITIAL_SIZE \t\t// (8 * 1024)\r\nstreamBuffers.DEFAULT_INCREMENT_AMOUNT\t// (8 * 1024)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWriting is standard Stream stuff:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.write(myBuffer);\r\n// - or -\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.write(\"\\u00bd + \\u00bc = \\u00be\", \"utf8\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can query the size of the data being held in the Buffer, and also how big the Buffer's max capacity currently is: \r\n\r\n```js\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.write(\"ASDF\");\r\nstreamBuffers.size();\t\t\t// 4.\r\nstreamBuffers.maxSize();\t\t// Whatever was configured as initial size. In our example: (100 * 1024).\r\n```\r\n\r\nRetrieving the contents of the Buffer is simple:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.getContents();\t\t\t\t\t// Gets all held data as a Buffer.\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.getContentsAsString(\"utf8\");\t\t// Gets all held data as a utf8 string.\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.getContents(5);\t\t\t\t\t// Gets first 5 bytes as a Buffer.\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.getContentsAsString(\"utf8\", 5);\t// Gets first 5 bytes as a utf8 string.\r\n```\r\n\r\nCare should be taken when getting encoded strings from WritableStream, as it doesn't really care about the contents (multi-byte characters will not be respected).\r\n \r\nDestroying or ending the WritableStream will not delete the contents of Buffer, but will disallow any further writes:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.write(\"ASDF\");\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.destroy();\r\n\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.getContents();\t\t// Returns ASDF in Buffer.\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.write(\"Yeah?\");\t\t// No effect.\r\n```\t\r\n\r\n### Readable StreamBuffer\r\n\r\nReadable Stream Buffers can have data inserted in them, which will then be pumped out via standard readable stream data events. The data to be sent out is held in a Buffer, which can grow in much the same way as a WritableStream Buffer does, if data is being put in Buffer faster than it's being pumped out. \r\n\r\nThe frequency in which chunks are pumped out, and the size of the chunks themselves can be configured in the constructor. The initial size and increment amount of internal Buffer can be configured too.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar myReadableStreamBuffer = new streamBuffers.ReadableStreamBuffer({\r\n\tfrequency: 10,\t\t// in milliseconds.\r\n\tchunkSize: 2048\t\t// in bytes.\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nDefault frequency and chunk size:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nstreamBuffers.DEFAULT_CHUNK_SIZE \t\t// (1024)\r\nstreamBuffers.DEFAULT_FREQUENCY\t\t\t// (1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nPutting data in Buffer to be pumped out is easy:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmyReadableStreamBuffer.put(aBuffer);\r\nmyReadableStreamBuffer.put(\"A String\", \"utf8\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nChunks are pumped out via standard readable stream spec: \r\n\r\n```js\r\nmyReadableStreamBuffer.on(\"data\", function(data) {\r\n\t// Yup.\r\n\tassert.isTrue(data instanceof Buffer);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nChunks are pumped out by the interval that you specified in frequency. Setting the frequency to 0 will immediately stream the data (also in chunks), even if the stream has not been piped to a destination. This is useful for unit testing. \r\n\r\nsetEncoding() for streams is respected too:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmyReadableStreamBuffer.setEncoding(\"utf8\");\r\nmyReadableStreamBuffer.on(\"data\", function(data) {\r\n\tassert.isTrue(data instanceof String);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nPause and resume are also implemented. pause()'ing stream will allow buffer to continue accumulating, but will not pump any of that data out until it is resume()'d again. \r\n\r\nDestroying the stream will immediately purge the buffer, unless destroySoon() is called, in which case the rest of the buffer will be written out. Either way, any further attempts to put data in the Buffer will be silently ignored. \r\n\r\n```js\r\nmyReadableStreamBuffer.destroySoon();\r\nmyReadableStreamBuffer.put(\"A String!\");\r\nmyReadableStreamBuffer.size();\t\t\t// will be 0.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Disclaimer\r\n\r\nNot supposed to be a speed demon, it's more for tests/debugging or weird edge cases. It works with an internal buffer that it copies contents to/from/around.\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\n\r\nThanks to the following people for taking some time to contribute to this project.\r\n\r\n * Igor Dralyuk <idralyuk@ebay.com>\r\n * Simon Koudijs <simon.koudijs@intellifi.nl>\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nnode-stream-buffer is free and unencumbered public domain software.

    "licenseText": "Structured Headers parser for Javascript\n========================================\n\nThis library is a parser and serializer for the [Structured Headers][1]\nspecification, a.k.a. \"Structured Field Values for HTTP\" (RFC8941).\n\nThis specification defines a standard serialization for complex HTTP header\nvalues, including lists (arrays), dictionaries (maps) and also numbers,\nbooleans, and binary data.\n\nThe library is written in Typescript, and the examples in this document are\ntoo, but plain Javascript is also fully supported.\n\nCompatibility\n-------------\n\nThis package has 2725 unittests, the vast majority are supplied from the\nofficial [HTTP WG test suite][2].\n\nHowever, there are 2 differences in the serializer:\n\n1. Javascript can't differentiate between `1.0` and `1`. As a result we're\n   skipping the tests that require a serialiation output of `1.0`.\n2. Javascript rounds slightly different from the spec. The tests suggest that\n   `0.0025` should round to the nearest event number (`0.002`), but Javascript\n   rounds to `0.003`.\n\nNo fix is planned for #1, because there's no reasonably way to fix this\nwithout wrapping every number in a custom class, and this will negatively\nimpact the developer experience. We do intend to fix #2 in the future with a\ncustom rounding algorithm.\n\nThis library emits and expects the _exact_ data structures as they are\nsuggested by the RFC. The result of this is that the returned types can be\na bit complex.\n\nIn the future we intend to loosen the required types for the serializer, and\nadd new helper functions that give you simpler structures _if_ you don't need\ncertain features for a header (such as `Parameters`).\n\nLet us know what you would like to see here!\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nUsing npm:\n\n```\nnpm install structured-headers\n```\n\nAPI\n---\n\n### Parsing an item\n\nThe following are examples of `item` headers:\n\nParsed as string\n\n```\n# Parsed as string\nHeader: \"foo\"\n\n# A simple string, called a 'Token' in the spec\nHeader: foo\n\n# Parsed as number\nHeader: 5\nHeader: -10\nHeader: 5.01415\n\n# Parsed into boolean\nHeader: ?1\nHeader: ?0\n\n# Binaries are base64 encoded\nHeader: :RE0gbWUgZm9yIGEgZnJlZSBjb29raWU=:\n\n# Items can have parameters\nHeader: \"Hello world\"; a=\"5\"\n```\n\n\nTo parse these header values, use the `parseItem`:\n\n```typescript\nimport { parseItem } from 'structured-headers';\n\nconsole.log(\n  parseItem(header)\n);\n```\n\nparseItem returns a tuple (array with 2 items), the first item is the value,\nthe second is a `Map` object with parameters.\n\nThe type is roughly:\n\n```typescript\n\n// The raw value\ntype BareItem = number | string | Token | ByteSequence | boolean;\n\n// The return type of parseItem\ntype Item = [\n  BareItem,\n  Map<string, BareItem>\n];\n```\n\n### Parsing a list\n\nA list is an array of items. Some examples:\n\n```\n# A simple list\nHeader: 5, \"foo\", bar, ?1\n\n# Each element can have parameters\nHeader: sometoken; param1; param2=hi, 42\n\n# A list can also contain lists itself. These are called 'inner lists' and\n# use parenthesis\nHeader: sometoken, (innerlistitem1 innerlistitem2), (anotherlist)\n```\n\n\nTo parse these:\n\n```typescript\nimport { parseList } from 'structured-headers';\n\nconsole.log(\n  parseList(header)\n);\n```\n\n`parseList` returns an array with each member. The return type is:\n\n```typescript\ntype InnerList = [Item[], Parameters];\ntype List = (InnerList|Item)[];\n```\n\n### Parsing a dictionary\n\nA dictionary is a key->value object. Examples:\n\n```\n# A simple dictionary\nHeader: fn=\"evert\", ln=\"pot\", coffee=?1\n\n# Each item may have parameters too\nHeader: foo=123; q=1, bar=123, q=0.5\n\n# A dictionary value may be an inner list again\nHeader: foo=(1 2 3)\n```\n\nTo parse dictionaries:\n\n```typescript\nimport { parseDictionary } from 'structured-headers';\n\nconsole.log(\n  parseDictionary(header)\n);\n```\n\nThe return type for `parseDictionary` is a `Map`.\n\n```typescript\ntype Dictionary = Map<string, Item|InnerList>;\n```\n\n\n### Serializing\n\nThe serialiser functions work the exact same way, but in opposite direction.\nThey all return strings.\n\nCurrently the serializes expect the *exact type* that the parsers return, but\nthe intention is to loosen the types for serialization, so it's a bit more\nergnomic to call. Want this? Let me know by opening an issue.\n\n\n```javascript\nimport {\n  serializeDictionary,\n  serializeList,\n  serializeItem\n} from 'structured-headers';\n\n\n// Returns \"foo\", \"bar\"\nserializeList([\n  ['foo', new Map()],\n  ['bar', new Map()],\n]);\n\n// Returns a=1, b=?0\nsh.serializeDictionary(new Map([\n  ['a', [1, new Map()]],\n  ['b', [false, new Map()]],\n]));\n\n// Returns 42\nserializeItem([42, new Map()]);\n\n// Returns 5.5\nserializeItem([5.5, new Map()]);\n\n// Returns \"hello world\"\nserializeItem([\"hello world\", new Map()]);\n\n// Returns ?1\nserializeItem([true, new Map()]);\n\n// Returns a base-64 representation like: *aGVsbG8=*\nserializeItem([new ByteSequence('aGVsbG8='), new Map()]);\n```\n\nBrowser support\n---------------\n\nThere is a minified version of this library in the `browser/` directory. This minified\nfile will expose a global variable called 'structuredHeader' which contains the rest\nof the api.\n\n\n[1]: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8941\n[2]: https://github.com/httpwg/structured-field-tests",

It is published under the\n> `@beta` tag on npm and contains new features and changes for the next major version.\n\nUtilising [tagged template literals](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/advanced#tagged-template-literals) (a recent addition to JavaScript) and the [power of CSS](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/api#supported-css), `styled-components` allows you to write actual CSS code to style your components. It also removes the mapping between components and styles – using components as a low-level styling construct could not be easier!\n\n```jsx\nconst Button = styled.button`\n  color: grey;\n`;\n```\n\nAlternatively, you may use [style objects](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/advanced#style-objects). This allows for easy porting of CSS from inline styles, while still supporting the more advanced styled-components capabilities like component selectors and media queries.\n\n```jsx\nconst Button = styled.button({\n  color: 'grey',\n});\n```\n\nEquivalent to:\n\n```jsx\nconst Button = styled.button`\n  color: grey;\n`;\n```\n\n`styled-components` is compatible with both React (for web) and React Native – meaning it's the perfect choice even for truly universal apps! See the [documentation about React Native](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/basics#react-native) for more information.\n\n_Supported by [Front End Center](https://frontend.center). Thank you for making this possible!_\n\n## Upgrading from v4\n\n1. `npm install styled-components@beta react@^16.8 react-dom@^16.8 react-is@^16.8`\n1. ??\n1. Profit!\n\n> Note that integrations like `jest-styled-components` that make use of internals will need to be updated to work with v5 and likely will not work properly during the alpha/beta period.\n\n## [Docs](https://www.styled-components.com/docs)\n\n**See the documentation at [styled-components.com/docs](https://www.styled-components.com/docs)** for more information about using `styled-components`!\n\nQuicklinks to some of the most-visited pages:\n\n- [**Getting started**](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/basics)\n- [API Reference](https://styled-components.com/docs/api)\n- [Theming](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/advanced#theming)\n- [Server-side rendering](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/advanced#server-side-rendering)\n- [Tagged Template Literals explained](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/advanced#tagged-template-literals)\n\n## Example\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore -->\n```JSX\nimport React from 'react';\n\nimport styled from 'styled-components';\n\n// Create a <Title> react component that renders an <h1> which is\n// centered, palevioletred and sized at 1.5em\nconst Title = styled.h1`\n  font-size: 1.5em;\n  text-align: center;\n  color: palevioletred;\n`;\n\n// Create a <Wrapper> react component that renders a <section> with\n// some padding and a papayawhip background\nconst Wrapper = styled.section`\n  padding: 4em;\n  background: papayawhip;\n`;\n\n// Use them like any other React component – except they're styled!\n<Wrapper>\n  <Title>Hello World, this is my first styled component!</Title>\n</Wrapper>\n```\n\nThis is what you'll see in your browser:\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <a href=\"https://styled-components.com\">\n    <img alt=\"Screenshot of the above code ran in a browser\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/wUJpcjY.jpg\" />\n  </a>\n</div>\n\n## Babel Macro\n\nIf you're using tooling that has babel-plugin-macros set up, you can switch to the `styled-components/macro` import path instead to gain the effects of the babel plugin without further setup.\n\n```js\nimport styled from 'styled-components/macro';\n\n// A static className will be generated for Title (important for SSR)\nconst Title = styled.h1`\n  font-size: 1.5em;\n  text-align: center;\n  color: palevioletred;\n`;\n```\n\nIf you wish to provide configuration options to the babel plugin similar to how you would in a `.babelrc`, [see this guide](https://github.com/kentcdodds/babel-plugin-macros/blob/master/other/docs/author.md#config-experimental). The config name is `\"styledComponents\"`.\n\n## Built with `styled-components`\n\nA lot of hard work goes into community libraries, projects, and guides.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

Subject to the terms and conditions of\n      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\n      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\n      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,\n      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the\n      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.\n\n   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\n      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\n      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\n      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,\n      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\n      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\n      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\n      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\n      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\r\n\r\n4. Redistribution.

The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.\r\n\r\n5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions.

This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\r\n\r\n7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\r\n\r\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS",

For the purposes\n      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain\n      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,\n      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.\n\n      \"Contribution\" shall mean any work of authorship, including\n      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions\n      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally\n      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner\n      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of\n      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, \"submitted\"\n      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent\n      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to\n      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,\n      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the\n      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but\n      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise\n      designated in writing by the copyright owner as \"Not a Contribution.\"\n\n      \"Contributor\" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity\n      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and\n      subsequently incorporated within the Work.\n\n   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\n      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\n      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\n      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,\n      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the\n      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.\n\n   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\n      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\n      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\n      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,\n      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\n      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\n      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\n      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\n      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

We also recommend that a\n      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the\n      same \"printed page\" as the copyright notice for easier\n      identification within third-party archives.\n\n   Copyright [yyyy] [name of copyright owner]\n\n   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n   You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n   distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n   limitations under the License.",
