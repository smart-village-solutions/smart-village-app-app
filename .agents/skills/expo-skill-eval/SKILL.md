# Expo Skill Eval

Evaluates skills in `plugins/expo/skills/` for trigger accuracy, generated code quality, and/or runtime rendering in Expo Go.

Requirements: macOS with Xcode (iOS simulators), Android SDK with at least one AVD, and `bun`. No other device tooling is assumed.

Workspace root: `/private/tmp/expo-skill-eval-<skill-name>/iteration-N/` (e.g. `/private/tmp/expo-skill-eval-expo-ui/iteration-4/`).

## Before starting — clarify scope

**Confirm all of the following up front, before any pipeline work — don't skip any** (only skip a given item if the request already states that choice). Batch them into `AskUserQuestion` calls of ≤4 questions each, in this order:

1. **Which skill** to eval (if not clear from the request).
2. **Prompts** — which prompts drive the eval. Built-in prompts (from the skill's eval cases) are **pre-selected all**; drop any, add a custom text prompt, or **build from an uploaded screenshot** (a target UI the skill must reproduce). See **Prompts** below.
3. **What to verify** — one multi-select of three options: Runtime + screenshots / Trigger accuracy / Code checks (no device). See *What to verify* below.
4. **Expo SDK** — latest (default, auto-detected) or a pinned version.
5. **Runner** — Expo Go (default) or development build.
6. **Platforms** — iOS / Android / web (always offer all three).
7. **Permission flag** for `claude -p` — skip-permissions (default) or accept-edits.
8. **Viewer delivery** — local only (default) or publish a shareable Artifact.
9. **If trigger accuracy is selected** — confirm the published `expo` plugin is disabled (or not installed).

Each is detailed below. Items 4–6 (SDK, runner, platforms) fit naturally in one `AskUserQuestion` call.

**If the skill to eval is not clear from the request**, list available skills from `plugins/expo/skills/` and ask which one to evaluate.

**How the skill under test is loaded — two mechanisms, one per phase** (don't pick one globally): executor runs reference it by **file path** (`SKILL_PATH = plugins/expo/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md`, read explicitly), while the trigger eval loads it as a **plugin** (`--plugin-dir plugins/expo`, so the model can auto-select it from its description). Both point at the *local, in-repo* version — that's what you're evaluating. You do **not** need any special flag to *launch* the harness session itself (the harness finds the skill by repo path); the mechanisms apply to the `claude -p` subprocesses it spawns. See steps 1 and 3 for why each phase differs. **One pre-run check (required when the trigger eval is in scope):** if the *published* `expo` plugin is installed/enabled, disable it (via `/plugin`) **before launching** the harness and re-enable after. A single disable is a global-config change that both this session and the spawned `claude -p` subprocesses inherit. Why it's required for the trigger eval: that phase loads the local skill via `--plugin-dir`, and a second installed `expo` collides with it — the model may trigger the *published* `expo:expo-ui`, and since detection only sees the tool-call name you'd silently score the published description instead of your local edits (the collision could also just error). The **executor / runtime / static** phases are *not* affected — they read the skill under test by its local `SKILL_PATH` with no `--plugin-dir` — so a run with no trigger eval can skip the disable. Disabling `expo` does **not** disable `expo-skill-eval` (a standalone project skill, not part of the `expo` plugin), so the harness stays available.

**Surface this to the user as an explicit up-front confirmation** — the same way you confirm which skill to eval. When the trigger eval is in scope, ask the user to confirm the published `expo` plugin is disabled (or not installed) *before* you start step 1; if it's still enabled, pause and have them disable it via `/plugin`. Don't run the trigger eval until they confirm — the harness can't reliably detect installed plugins on its own (reading the global plugin config or `claude plugin list` would prompt), so this is a manual confirmation, not an auto-check.

**Pick the prompts — built-in, custom, or a target screenshot.** The prompts are the *inputs* that drive the executor (with-skill and without-skill); they are separate from what you *verify*. Confirm them with `AskUserQuestion` (skip if the request already names a prompt):

- **Built-in prompts** — representative prompts you generate by reading the skill under test (its `SKILL.md` + `references/`) and `references/runtime-matrix.md`, covering the skill's standard use cases. (If the skill already ships eval cases under `evals/evals.json`, fold their `prompt` fields in too — but most skills don't, so you usually derive them.) **Pre-select all** so the default run exercises the skill's standard cases; let the user deselect any.
- **Custom text prompt** — a one-off prompt the user types. Don't spend a dedicated option slot on this: `AskUserQuestion` auto-adds a **"Type something"** / Other entry, and anything typed there becomes a custom text case.
- **Build from an uploaded screenshot** — the user gives the path to a **target screenshot** (a UI to reproduce). The executor is told to open it — `claude -p` reads PNGs with its Read tool — and build an app matching it; the case records the path as `reference_image`, and grading compares the generated app to that target (step 6). This is the strongest visual test for a UI skill: "build *this*."

**Respect `AskUserQuestion`'s 4-option-per-question cap with this priority** (the bug to avoid: the upload option silently dropped once the four slots fill up):

1. **Always reserve a slot for "Build from an uploaded screenshot."** It's the whole point of the visual eval and must never be the option that gets dropped.
2. **Don't add an explicit "Custom text prompt" option** — the auto "Type something" / Other entry already covers it.
3. Fill the remaining ≤3 slots with the built-in/representative prompts, **pre-selected**. If there are more than 3, collapse them into one pre-selected **"All built-in prompts (default)"** option and offer subset-picking in a short follow-up, so the upload option still fits.

Present it as a **multi-select**. When "Build from an uploaded screenshot" is picked, ask for the target image path in a follow-up. Each selected prompt (built-in, typed, or image) becomes one eval case (run with-skill and without-skill).

**Always confirm what to verify** unless the request makes it unambiguous. Present these options and let the user pick one or more (defaults in bold based on the skill's `references/runtime-matrix.md` entry):

| Option | What it does | When to suggest as default |
|--------|-------------|---------------------------|
| **Runtime + screenshots** | Full pipeline: fixture → executor → static gate → run the app on iOS/Android and screenshot it. The runner (Expo Go or dev build) is a separate question — don't name it here. | **Default** for any skill that renders an app screen (the `expo-go`/`dev-build` rows in `references/runtime-matrix.md`). Requires a booted simulator/emulator. |
| **Trigger accuracy** | Run realistic prompts via `claude -p`, check whether the skill is read. Measures recall (should-trigger queries only). | Always useful as a standalone check. |
| **Code checks (no device)** | `tsc --noEmit` + diff-aware lint + `expo export`, plus the grader checks the generated code against any custom expectations you provide. No device. | **Default** for `static-only` and `n/a` skills, and whenever you want to verify code patterns (correct import path, a `Host` wrapper, …) without running the app. |
**Present these as ONE multi-select question — *"What do you want to verify?"*** These are *grading dimensions* (how to judge what gets built) — distinct from the **Prompts** phase (what to build). The user may pick any combination. When a prompt is an **uploaded screenshot** (see **Prompts**), include **"Runtime + screenshots"** so the harness captures the generated app and the grader can score it against the target.

Read `references/runtime-matrix.md` to find the skill's default mode before suggesting. If the request already specifies a mode (e.g. "just check if it triggers", "run it on device"), skip the question and proceed.

**Pick the Expo SDK version — once, up front.** Detect the latest with `bash /abs/path/expo-skill-eval/scripts/latest-sdk.sh` (it prints the major, e.g. `56`; internally it uses `bun` to run `npm view expo dist-tags --json` and read the major via `JSON.parse`/`semver`, and it's covered by the bash-scripts rule — so don't run the registry query inline yourself, which would prompt). Then confirm with `AskUserQuestion`: default to that latest SDK, or let the user pin an older one (e.g. to reproduce a version-specific issue). Use the chosen version everywhere the fixture is built — pass it as the `<sdk>` arg to `make-fixture.sh` and write it into each eval case's `runtime.sdk`. If the request already names a version ("eval on SDK 54"), skip detection and use it.

**Default to the latest** — it stays compatible with the Expo Go that `expo start` installs on the device. Pinning an SDK *older* than the device's installed Expo Go makes `expo start` try to prompt "Install the recommended Expo Go version?"; with no TTY (the snapshot scripts read stdin from `/dev/null`) it dies with `Input is required, but 'npx expo' is in non-interactive mode` and **every snapshot fails**. So only pin an older SDK when you also pre-install a matching Expo Go on the simulator/emulator — otherwise stick with latest.

**Pick the runner — Expo Go (default) or a development build.** Ask with `AskUserQuestion` (skip if the request already says which):

- **Expo Go (default)** — the snapshot scripts run the app with `expo start --ios` / `expo start --android` as-is. Fast (no native compile), and it runs anything Expo Go bundles (including `@expo/ui` on SDK 56+). Cannot run custom native code (expo-modules, config plugins, native deps not in Expo Go).
- **Development build** — the snapshot scripts run `expo run:ios` / `expo run:android` instead, compiling a native dev client per fixture. Use this for skills whose output needs custom native code (the cases that would otherwise be `static-only`). Much slower — `expo run` prebuilds and natively compiles each fixture (minutes, especially the first), and needs the full iOS/Android build toolchain — so only choose it when the skill actually requires native code. **Disk-heavy:** each fixture's native build is multi-GB. The snapshot phase runs `clean-fixture.sh` after each fixture to keep peak usage to ~one build, but still prefer fewer eval cases and a **single platform** for dev-build runs, and keep a few GB free. `clean-fixture.sh` removes the per-fixture build *output* (`node_modules`, `ios`, `android`, `.expo`, `dist`, and the fixture's iOS DerivedData) and keeps the app source + git. The lever for dev-build disk is **fewer eval cases + one platform** — it only reclaims per-fixture build output and never touches shared dependency caches, so nothing gets re-downloaded.

Pass the choice to the snapshot scripts via the `EXPO_SKILL_EVAL_RUNNER` env var (`expo-go` default, or `dev-build`), and reflect it in each eval case's `runtime.mode` (`expo-go` or `dev-build`). See step 5.

**Pick the platforms — always ask, regardless of skill.** Offer iOS / Android / web (multi-select) with `AskUserQuestion`; default to iOS + Android, but always present web as an option — don't pre-filter by skill. **Web is a valid choice for most skills**: `@expo/ui`'s *universal* components (`Host`, `Row`, `Column`, `Button`, `List`, …) render on web, as do `expo-dom`, NativeWind/Tailwind, API routes, and plain React Native. The only thing that won't show on web is a *platform-specific* native tree (`@expo/ui/swift-ui` or `@expo/ui/jetpack-compose`), which renders blank there — and that blank is itself a useful signal, so it's still the user's call. Web runs via `snapshot-web.sh` (`expo start --web` + Playwright/Chromium) **regardless of the runner** (`expo run` is native-only; there's no web dev build), and it's the least-exercised path. Write the chosen set into each eval case's `runtime.platforms` and have `run_snapshots.py` loop them.

**Confirm how `claude -p` subprocesses run — once, before starting.** Ask with `AskUserQuestion` whether they may run with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, then apply the same answer to every subprocess this run (never re-prompt mid-run):

- **Skip permissions (recommended)** — pass `--dangerously-skip-permissions`. Each subprocess runs unattended inside a throwaway fixture under `/private/tmp/expo-skill-eval-*` and can write files and run setup commands without prompting.
- **Accept edits only** — pass `--permission-mode acceptEdits` instead. Bash/installs are auto-denied (no TTY), so some evals may produce partial output.

A bare `claude -p` with neither flag can't write files at all. If the request already states a preference ("skip permissions", "don't use the dangerous flag"), skip the question.

**Confirm how to deliver the results viewer — once, up front.** Publishing to claude.ai is outward-facing, so never do it mid-run by surprise; ask in the same up-front `AskUserQuestion` (alongside the permission flag):

- **Local only (default)** — `generate_viewer.py` writes `viewer.html` and opens it in the local browser. Nothing leaves the machine.
- **Publish a shareable Artifact** — additionally render the viewer to a claude.ai Artifact (a default-private web page the user can share with teammates) at the very end. Only do this if the user opts in here.

If the request already says whether to share/publish, skip the question. See the **Viewer** section for the publish mechanics.

## Eval case schema

You generate the run's eval cases — one per chosen prompt — and write them to `<workspace>/iteration-N/evals.json` (the viewer reads them from there). Each case extends the standard skill-creator eval-case shape with a `runtime` block and visual expectations:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "prompt": "Build me a settings screen with a dark mode toggle and a list of options",
  "expected_output": "Working Expo Router screen",
  "expectations": [
    "Uses Expo Router file-based routing",
    "TypeScript compiles with no errors"
  ],
  "runtime": {
    "mode": "expo-go",
    "platforms": ["ios", "android"],
    "sdk": "56"
  },
  "visual_expectations": [
    "No red error screen or Expo Go error overlay on any platform",
    "A settings screen with a visible toggle control is rendered"
  ]
}
```

- `runtime.mode`: how the eval runs after the static gate —
  - `"expo-go"`: run in Expo Go (`expo start --<platform>`) and screenshot. Fast, JS-only. **Default.**
  - `"dev-build"`: build a native dev client (`expo run:<platform>`) and screenshot. For skills whose output uses custom native code; much slower (native compile per fixture).
  - `"static-only"`: stop after the static gate — for skills that produce no UI, or when you don't want to run a device at all (CI).

  Consult `references/runtime-matrix.md` for which repo skills support which mode. (`dev-build` lets you actually run skills that previously had to be `static-only` for needing native code.)
- `runtime.platforms`: subset of `ios`, `android`, `web` — chosen up front (always offered, not gated on the skill; see **Before starting**). Defaults to `["ios", "android"]`.
- `runtime.sdk`: Expo SDK major for the fixture app — set it to the version chosen up front (see **Before starting — clarify scope**). Omit to use the latest template.
- `reference_image` (optional — **image prompt**): absolute path to a **target screenshot** the skill must reproduce. When set, the executor is told to open it (via its Read tool) and build a matching app, and the grader scores how closely the generated app reproduces it (step 6) on top of the usual expectations. Set in the **Prompts** phase via "build from an uploaded screenshot."

An image-prompt case is a normal case with `reference_image` set; enable "Runtime + screenshots" so the harness captures the result to compare against the target:

```json
{
  "prompt": "Build an app whose UI matches the attached reference screenshot.",
  "reference_image": "/abs/path/to/target.png",
  "runtime": { "mode": "expo-go", "platforms": ["ios"], "sdk": "56" },
  "visual_expectations": ["Matches the reference's layout, components, and color treatment"]
}
```

## Pipeline per eval case

**Orchestration model — on the main thread you run `python3 <orchestrator>` and almost nothing else.** Every phase is driven by a small Python orchestrator you `Write` into the workspace and run with `python3 /private/tmp/expo-skill-eval-<skill>/<phase>.py` (covered by the `python3` rule). The orchestrators are the **only** place the `scripts/*.sh` files are invoked — always via `subprocess.run(["bash", "<scripts>/<name>.sh", …])`, which runs as a child of `python3` and needs no rule of its own — and the only place parallelism, logging, and directory creation live. So on the main thread you only ever: **Write** orchestrators, **run** them with `python3`, **inspect** outputs with the `Read`/`Glob`/`Grep` tools, and **spawn the grader subagent**. Never put a command inside a chained/backgrounded/piped shell construct, and never run ad-hoc `mkdir`/`ls`/`cat`/`tail`/`echo` — that is what prompts. (A single standalone `bash …/scripts/<name>.sh …` is fine for one-off manual debugging, e.g. re-running one flaky snapshot, but the pipeline itself goes through the orchestrators.) **Run each orchestrator in the foreground** — let the tool call block until it finishes; the orchestrators already parallelize *within* a phase, so you don't need to overlap phases. Do **not** shell-background a phase with `… & echo "$!"` / `wait` (the `&`, `echo`, and `wait` segments have no rule and prompt). If you genuinely must run a phase while continuing other work, use the **Bash tool's `run_in_background` parameter** on a plain `python3 <orchestrator> 2>&1 | tee <ws>/…log` call — never hand-rolled shell `&`. **Expect exactly one permission prompt at the very start:** the first `Write` into the workspace. `allowed-tools` can suppress `Bash`/`Read` but not `Write`/`Edit`, so choose **"allow all edits in this directory for the session"** on that first prompt — it covers every orchestrator, `evals.json`, and viewer file for the whole run.

### 0. Workspace setup

Create the run's directory tree once, with the workspace script — **never with ad-hoc `mkdir`** (a raw `mkdir` prompts: there is no `mkdir` rule, and a `"$WORKSPACE/…"` variable can't match a path glob anyway):

```bash
bash /abs/path/expo-skill-eval/scripts/make-workspace.sh /private/tmp/expo-skill-eval-<skill> iteration-N <num-evals>
```

This creates `trigger-evals/scratch` and `iteration-N/eval-<i>/{with_skill,without_skill}/outputs` for every eval. It is covered by `Bash(bash *expo-skill-eval/scripts/*)`, and the `mkdir`s inside run as children of the script (no rule of their own). After this, every other directory is made by the scripts/orchestrators that need it (`make-fixture.sh`, the executor orchestrator's `os.makedirs`, the snapshot scripts) or by the `Write` tool auto-creating parents — so you never need another `mkdir`.

### 1. Trigger eval (should-trigger only)

Write a `run_trigger_eval_real.py` script under the workspace's `trigger-evals/` directory. Use **only `"should_trigger": true` queries** — the expo plugin is a family of complementary skills, so multiple skills triggering on the same prompt is not a failure. Measure recall only: realistic prompts that should use the skill, scored by trigger rate.

The script should run `claude -p <query>` per query (with `--output-format=stream-json --verbose --include-partial-messages`, `CLAUDECODE` stripped from the env, and the permission flag confirmed up front in **Before starting — clarify scope**) and detect whether the target skill was triggered by watching for its `Skill` or `Read` tool call in the stream. Note: `--include-partial-messages` requires both `--output-format=stream-json` and `--verbose` — omitting either causes an immediate CLI error.

**Load the skill under test — pass `--plugin-dir` to every trigger subprocess.** The trigger eval measures whether the skill's *description* makes the model reach for it, so the subprocess must have the **local** skill (the version with your edits) loaded. A `claude -p` subprocess does **not** inherit the parent session's `--plugin-dir`, so add it explicitly: `--plugin-dir <plugin-root>`, where `<plugin-root>` is the **absolute** path to the plugin directory that owns the skill — the `plugins/expo` ancestor containing `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (e.g. `--plugin-dir /Users/.../skills/plugins/expo`). It must be absolute: the subprocess runs from the throwaway `scratch/` cwd, so a relative `plugins/expo` won't resolve — and a missing plugin dir silently loads nothing, which masquerades as a 0% trigger rate. Then watch for the skill triggering under its plugin-qualified name (`<plugin>:<skill>`, e.g. `expo:expo-ui`). Two caveats: (1) if the **published** `expo` plugin is also installed globally, disable it (via `/plugin`) for the run and re-enable after — otherwise two copies of `expo` collide in the subprocess and the model may trigger the *published* `expo:expo-ui`, silently scoring its description instead of your local edits (trigger detection only sees the tool-call name, so it can't tell the copies apart; dev checkouts usually don't have it installed). (2) Never make a synthetic duplicate of the skill — a real loaded copy always wins, so the synthetic harness scores 0%. (Executors are unaffected by an installed plugin: they read the local `SKILL_PATH` directly and pass no `--plugin-dir`.)

Run each query's subprocess from an empty throwaway cwd (e.g. `trigger-evals/scratch/`), not the repo root. A should-trigger prompt like "build me a settings screen" can make the subprocess write files, and with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` those writes would otherwise land in the skills repo. Trigger detection only needs the skill's `Skill`/`Read` call to appear in the stream — it doesn't need a fixture — so any incidental writes are throwaway.

Set a per-query subprocess timeout of at least **300 seconds**. A 180s limit is too short — some queries cause the model to start generating code before triggering the skill, which pushes total runtime past 3 minutes.

Run trigger evals once per skill, not per code eval case.

### 2. Fixture

Each executor run gets a fresh Expo app, created by `scripts/make-fixture.sh <app-path> <sdk> [clean|full]`:

```bash
scripts/make-fixture.sh <workspace>/iteration-N/eval-X/<config>/app <sdk>          # blank app (default)
scripts/make-fixture.sh <workspace>/iteration-N/eval-X/<config>/app <sdk> full     # keep example tabs
```

The script creates the app with `bunx create-expo-app -t default@sdk-<version>` (or the latest template when no version is given) once per SDK version + variant, caches it under `~/.cache/expo-skill-eval/fixtures/`, and clones the cache with APFS copy-on-write — so the first run per variant pays the install cost and every later run is near-instant. The default `clean` variant runs the template's `reset-project` script, so executors start from a blank app and every screen in the output is theirs — a much cleaner grading signal. Use `full` only when the eval prompt assumes an existing app (e.g. "I have an app with two tabs..."). The script also resets git inside the clone, so `git diff` in the app shows exactly what the executor changed (useful evidence for the grader).

**Build fixtures sequentially, then fan out executors — never create fixtures concurrently.** `make-fixture.sh` shares a cache under `~/.cache/expo-skill-eval/fixtures/` keyed by SDK+variant. If two runs both find the cache cold and call `bunx create-expo-app` at the same time, bun's link step collides and one fails with `EEXIST` / "could not determine executable to run for package create-expo-app". So in the executor orchestrator (step 3), create **all** fixtures one at a time first — a plain Python loop calling `subprocess.run(["bash", "<scripts>/make-fixture.sh", app, sdk, variant])` (where `sdk` is the version chosen up front) — *then* fan out the `claude -p` executors with a `ThreadPoolExecutor`. Sequential creation is cheap: only the first fixture per SDK+variant pays the install cost; the rest are ~1s APFS clones. (And never fan fixtures out with ad-hoc shell like `make-fixture.sh A & make-fixture.sh B & wait` — the `&`/`wait` segments prompt; the sequential Python loop avoids both the race and the prompt.)

### 3. Generate (executor subagents)

Run executors as `claude -p` subprocess calls from a Python script, **not** via the `Agent` tool. The `Agent` tool spawns subagents with their own permission context — file edits inside the fixture app will prompt the user. A `claude -p` subprocess is a separate process outside the permission system entirely (the same pattern the trigger eval harness uses).

Write a Python script to `/private/tmp/expo-skill-eval-<skill>/run_executors.py`. **First create every run's fixture in a sequential loop** — `subprocess.run(["bash", "<scripts>/make-fixture.sh", app, sdk, variant], …)` one at a time (concurrent creation races the shared bun cache — see step 2). **Then** run the with-skill and without-skill `claude -p` calls in parallel via a `ThreadPoolExecutor`. Both phases live inside Python (covered by the `python3` rule), so nothing runs as ad-hoc shell on the main thread. Each executor prompt must include:

- The skill path (with-skill runs only) and the eval prompt.
- **Image-prompt cases (`reference_image` set):** the absolute path to the target screenshot plus an instruction like "Open the reference screenshot at `<path>` with your Read tool and build an app whose UI matches it as closely as you can — layout, components, spacing, and colors." (`claude -p` renders PNGs read this way, so the executor can actually see the target.)
- The fixture app path: "Make your changes inside `<app-path>`. The project already exists and has dependencies installed. Use absolute paths for all file operations."
- "Before writing any files, inspect the project layout — run `ls`, read `package.json` and `app.json` — to find the correct routes directory. Recent SDK default templates place Expo Router routes in `src/app/`; older ones use `app/` at the project root — inspect to confirm which this fixture uses."
- "Do NOT start the dev server, boot simulators, or take screenshots — the harness does that after you finish."
- Where to save a short summary of what was built.

Flags for the `claude -p` subprocess:
- Strip `CLAUDECODE` from the environment (`env = {k: v for k, v in os.environ.items() if k != "CLAUDECODE"}`) — otherwise `claude -p` hangs silently when nested inside a running Claude Code session.
- A permission flag, confirmed with the user up front (see **Before starting — clarify scope**): either `--dangerously-skip-permissions` or `--permission-mode acceptEdits`. Bake the chosen flag into the generated script. A bare `claude -p` with neither flag can't write files — it has no TTY to approve the edit and emits code as text instead.
- **Do NOT pass `--plugin-dir` to executors** (unlike the trigger eval). The with-skill run already reads the skill by its absolute `SKILL_PATH`, so it tests the local content directly; and the without-skill run must have **no** skill available at all — loading the plugin would let the skill auto-trigger and contaminate the baseline. Keeping executors path-based also cleanly separates the two questions: the executor measures *content quality* (is the skill useful once read?), the trigger eval measures *triggering* (does the description get it picked?).

Capture stdout/stderr per run to a log file next to the fixture for grading evidence. Set timeout to 900s per executor — with-skill runs read multiple reference files before coding and regularly take 5–10 minutes.

### 4. Static gate

Write `run_static.py` and run it with `python3`. For each eval/config app it calls `subprocess.run(["bash", "<scripts>/check-static.sh", app, "ios,android"], capture_output=True, …)` across a `ThreadPoolExecutor` (static gates are independent — run them concurrently *inside Python*, never with shell `&`/`wait`), and writes each result to `eval-<i>/<config>/static.json` (exit code + captured output) for the grader.

`check-static.sh` runs `tsc --noEmit`, `expo lint`, and `expo export` for the listed platforms. A passing export catches most import/syntax/missing-module failures without touching a device; a failing export short-circuits step 5 with a clean FAIL — record it and have the snapshot orchestrator skip that app.

### 5. Run + screenshot (serial across evals)

Write `run_snapshots.py` and run it with `python3`. Simulators and emulators are shared resources, so this orchestrator runs **serially** (no thread pool): for each app that passed the static gate, and each platform, it `os.makedirs` the `outputs/` dir and calls `subprocess.run(["bash", "<scripts>/snapshot-<platform>.sh", app, f"{outputs}/<platform>.png", port], env={**os.environ, "EXPO_SKILL_EVAL_RUNNER": runner}, …)`. Pass the port as a positional argument: use `8081` for iOS and `8082` for Android — `expo run:ios/android --port N` is supported and using separate ports lets you run both platforms without port collisions if you ever parallelize. Screenshots land in the run's `outputs/` directory so the viewer renders them inline.

**Reclaim disk after each fixture — essential for `dev-build` runs.** Once all selected platforms for an app are captured (and *before* the next fixture builds), call `subprocess.run(["bash", "<scripts>/clean-fixture.sh", app])`. Each `expo run:<platform>` leaves multi-GB native build output (iOS Pods + DerivedData, Android Gradle build); without this, evals × configs × iterations pile up and fill the disk mid-run (the instability you'll see is the disk filling). `clean-fixture.sh` removes the heavy regenerable dirs (`node_modules`, `ios`, `android`, `.expo`, `dist`) and the fixture's iOS DerivedData, keeping the app source + git so the grader's `git diff` still works. With serial snapshots + per-fixture cleanup, peak disk stays at ~one fixture's build instead of all of them. (Harmless for `expo-go` runs too — they just have little to reclaim.)

`runner` is the up-front choice (`expo-go` default, or `dev-build`). The snapshot scripts honor `EXPO_SKILL_EVAL_RUNNER`: `expo-go` launches with `expo start --<platform>` (and the Expo Go install/deep-link dance); `dev-build` launches with `expo run:<platform> --port <port>`, which compiles+installs a native dev client and skips the Expo Go steps. The scripts already default the `dev-build` timeout to 900s, but bump `EXPO_SKILL_EVAL_BUNDLE_TIMEOUT` higher if the first native compile needs it. `make-fixture.sh` pre-installs `expo-dev-client` in every fixture so the dev-client URL scheme is registered before `expo run` tries to deep-link the app open.

**Snapshot scripts always capture the initial route `/`.** They open the app via a deep link and take one screenshot — they cannot tap or navigate. Design eval prompts so the feature under test renders at the root route. If the executor places the main UI behind a navigation action (e.g. an "Open Settings" button on the index), the snapshot will miss the feature entirely and all visual expectations will fail.

Each `snapshot-<platform>.sh` **frees its Metro port on startup** (kills any stale process left on it by a crashed prior run) and tears Metro down on exit — so you never need to run `lsof`/`kill`/`pkill` yourself to clear ports (that would prompt, and it's already handled). It then starts Metro, waits for the "Bundled" line in the Metro log, settles, captures a screenshot, and tears Metro down. iOS boots the newest available iPhone simulator if none is booted; Android boots the first AVD if no device is attached (the slow path — boot once and reuse across the whole iteration). Android first **recycles a wedged/`offline` emulator** (graceful `adb emu kill`, then force-kill + adb reset) so a half-dead instance can't poison the run, and boots with **hardware GPU** (`-gpu host`, Metal-accelerated on Apple Silicon). If `host` self-aborts the emulator on a given machine (qemu `SIGABRT` deep in gfxstream/Metal — possible on Apple Silicon under load), edit `GPU_MODE` in `snapshot-android.sh` to a software mode (`guest` renders reliably but slowly — bump the settle; avoid `swiftshader_indirect`, which **hangs at boot** on arm64). `snapshot-web.sh` runs only when `platforms` includes web. Each script writes a Metro log next to the screenshot (`<name>.metro.log`) — include it in the grader's inputs. If a script exits non-zero it still attempts a best-effort screenshot (an error screen is evidence too). **dev-build relaunch:** after Metro is up, the scripts relaunch the app via `xcrun simctl launch` (iOS) and `adb shell am start -n <pkg>/.MainActivity` (Android) — both avoid the "Open in X?" system dialog that a URL-scheme deep link triggers on first launch.

After all screenshots for the iteration are captured, always generate the viewer — pass the workspace root to the checked-in script:

```bash
python3 /abs/path/expo-skill-eval/scripts/generate_viewer.py /private/tmp/expo-skill-eval-<skill>
```

It writes `viewer.html` into the workspace root (one level above `iteration-N/`) and opens it in the browser itself (via `webbrowser.open`) — so no separate `open` command (and no `Bash(open:*)` rule) is needed. See the **Viewer** section below.

### 6. Grade

Spawn a grader subagent in the foreground. Its prompt must include:

- The eval prompt, expectations list, and visual_expectations from the eval case.
- The instructions in `agents/visual-grader.md` (screenshot grading, redbox detection).
- The screenshot files, Metro logs, and the step-4 `static.json` as inputs.
- **Image-prompt cases** (case has `reference_image`): also include the **target screenshot** (`reference_image`), `references/design-rubric.md`, and the fixture's `git diff`. Tell the grader to compare the generated screenshot(s) to the target and emit the `reference_match` + `quality` blocks below.

The grader writes `grading.json` next to the outputs with this shape:
```json
{
  "score": 8.5,
  "max_score": 9,
  "expectations": [
    {"text": "...", "passed": true, "evidence": "..."}
  ],
  "reference_match": {
    "score": 7, "max": 10,
    "evidence": "ios.png vs target.png: same two-section grouped list + toggle; accent color differs (blue vs target's green); row spacing tighter than target"
  },
  "quality": {
    "dimensions": [
      {"name": "Layout & hierarchy", "score": 2, "max": 3, "evidence": "ios.png: …"}
    ],
    "subtotal": 17,
    "max": 24,
    "summary": "…"
  },
  "user_notes_summary": {"needs_review": false, "notes": ""}
}
```
Visual expectations go into the same `expectations` array with evidence naming the screenshot file and describing what is visible. The `reference_match` block (how closely the generated app reproduces the target screenshot) and the `quality` block (design-rubric scores from `references/design-rubric.md`) are emitted **only for image-prompt cases** — or when a quality grade is explicitly requested. Omit both for plain text-prompt runs.

## Rollout phases

Build out and debug the pipeline in this order — each phase is independently useful:

1. **Static**: steps 1–4 only (`runtime.mode: "static-only"` for everything). No devices needed; CI-friendly.
2. **iOS**: add `snapshot-ios.sh` to the loop. `simctl` is the most scriptable target.
3. **Android**: add `snapshot-android.sh`. Emulator boot is the slowest part — keep one emulator running for the whole session.
4. **Web**: add `snapshot-web.sh` for skills that target web (uses Playwright via `bunx`; first run downloads Chromium).

## Practical notes

- **Temp locations**: all eval workspaces go under `/private/tmp/expo-skill-eval-<skill-name>/iteration-N/`. Everything in this run — `Read`, `Write`, `Edit`, and `Bash` — is covered by the `allowed-tools` frontmatter, so a correctly-loaded skill runs prompt-free.
- **Permission rule forms (why this skill stays prompt-free)**: the rule *syntax* matters and the two tool families behave differently:
  - **`Bash(...)` rules — path-scoped to the skill's own code (no broad interpreters).** `Bash(python3 /private/tmp/expo-skill-eval-*)` (plus the `/tmp` alias) runs the Python orchestrators you generate under the workspace; `Bash(python3 *expo-skill-eval/scripts/*)` runs the checked-in `scripts/generate_viewer.py`; `Bash(tee /private/tmp/expo-skill-eval-*)` (+ `/tmp`) lets `python3 … 2>&1 | tee <workspace>/…log` write a log without prompting; `Bash(bash *expo-skill-eval/scripts/*)` runs only this skill's `scripts/*.sh`. Because every path is pinned, the escape hatches stay denied: `python3 -c …`, `bash -c …`, `tee /etc/…`, and running code anywhere else do **not** match (verified empirically — a scoped rule allows `bash <dir>/run.sh` but blocks `bash -c …` and any other path). Commands the scripts call internally — `bunx`, `xcrun simctl`, `adb`, `git`, `mkdir`, `expo` — are children of the script, not Bash tool calls, so they need no rule. Do **not** run ad-hoc `mkdir`/`ls`/`find`/`cat`/`grep` from the main thread (they have no rule and prompt — and a raw `mkdir "$WORKSPACE/…"` can't match a path glob because the path is an unexpanded variable): create the directory tree with `make-workspace.sh` (step 0), let orchestrators create their own dirs (`os.makedirs`), and **inspect results with the `Read`/`Glob`/`Grep` tools** (no Bash rule needed).
  - **Bash rule matching (tested, non-obvious):** a Bash rule is a gitignore-style glob over the command string. `*` matches any run of characters **including `/` and spaces** and works **mid-pattern** — so `Bash(python3 /private/tmp/expo-skill-eval-*)` matches `python3 /private/tmp/expo-skill-eval-x/run.py 2>&1`, and `Bash(bash *expo-skill-eval/scripts/*)` matches `bash /any/abs/path/expo-skill-eval/scripts/foo.sh args`. Two gotchas that burned earlier attempts: `**` is matched **literally** (never use it in a Bash rule), and the `:*` suffix only works right after the command token (`Bash(python3:*)`) — **not** after a partial path (`Bash(python3 /path-:*)` does not match). Compound commands split on `|`, `&&`, `||`, `;`, `&` and each segment needs its own matching rule.
  - **`Read` rules suppress prompts; `Write`/`Edit` rules do *not*.** This is a Claude Code asymmetry (not a pattern bug, and not reload — in a session where the `Bash`/`Read` rules from this same frontmatter are clearly working, `Write` still prompts): file creation/editing always goes through Claude Code's edit-approval flow regardless of `allowed-tools`. The frontmatter still scopes `Read`/`Write`/`Edit` to `…/expo-skill-eval-*/**` (both the `/tmp` and `/private/tmp` forms, since macOS doesn't auto-resolve the symlink) as documentation and a guardrail, but those `Write`/`Edit` entries won't silence the prompt on their own. **Practical consequence:** at the start of a run you get **one** Write prompt for the workspace — choose **"Yes, allow all edits in this directory for the session"** and every later orchestrator / `evals.json` / viewer write under that workspace goes through silently. That single directory approval, not a rule, is what makes file-writing prompt-free.
  - **Reload after editing frontmatter — a full restart, not `/reload-skills`.** `allowed-tools` is read once when the skill loads at session start; `/reload-skills` reloads the skill *body* but does **not** reliably refresh the permission rules. After editing this file, **quit Claude Code entirely and start a new session**, then re-run the skill — otherwise a stale (cached) ruleset keeps prompting even though the file on disk is correct.
  - **Grader subagents** run with their own permission context and will still prompt for file access — that is expected and separate from the main thread's rules.
- **Calling eval scripts — one standalone command, never chained.** Invoke each script as its own Bash call with an absolute path: `bash /abs/path/expo-skill-eval/scripts/snapshot-ios.sh arg1 arg2` (covered by `Bash(bash *expo-skill-eval/scripts/*)`). Do **not** combine it with `&`, `&&`, `||`, `;`, `wait`, `tail`, `head`, or `echo` — compound commands are checked per segment, and those extra segments have no rule, so the whole thing prompts even though the `bash …/scripts/…` part is allowed. (The one allowed pipe is `… 2>&1 | tee <workspace>/…log`, since the scoped `tee` rule covers it.) Need parallelism or output trimming? Put it in a Python orchestrator (covered by `python3 /…/expo-skill-eval-*`), which runs scripts via `subprocess` across a `ThreadPoolExecutor`. Inspect results with the `Read`/`Glob`/`Grep` tools, not `cat`/`ls`/`grep`. **General rule: under this skill's tight scoping, any ad-hoc shell the agent improvises will prompt — the fix is to move it into a script/orchestrator (or use the scoped `tee`), never to broaden a rule.**
- **Inspecting outputs (screenshots, logs, files) — use tools, not shell.** To find files use the **Glob** tool (e.g. `/private/tmp/expo-skill-eval-<skill>/iteration-N/**/ios.png`); to view them use the **Read** tool — Read renders PNGs visually, which is exactly what you need to confirm a screenshot rendered. To search file contents use **Grep**. Never use `find`/`ls`/`cat` for this: they prompt, and `find … -exec …` is deliberately *not* allowed because its `-exec` can run anything (e.g. `-exec rm`). These tools are scoped and prompt-free; reach for them every time you'd otherwise type `find`/`ls`/`cat`.
- **Generated Python scripts**: write orchestration/aggregation scripts under the workspace (e.g. `/private/tmp/expo-skill-eval-<skill>/aggregate.py`) and run them with `python3` (covered by `Bash(python3 /private/tmp/expo-skill-eval-*)`). The viewer is the exception — it's the checked-in `scripts/generate_viewer.py`, run via `Bash(python3 *expo-skill-eval/scripts/*)`. `Write` auto-creates parent dirs but prompts the first time — approve the workspace directory once (see the `Write`/`Edit` note above). Capture output either by having the script write its own log or via `python3 … 2>&1 | tee <workspace>/…log` (covered by the scoped `tee` rule); read logs back with the `Read` tool. Don't use `python3 -c …` for setup (the scoped rule only matches a workspace script *path*, so a bare `-c` prompts).

- **Trigger evals vs installed plugin**: detect the real installed skill name (e.g. `expo:expo-ui`) in the stream — a synthetic-duplicate harness always scores 0% when the real plugin is installed because the model picks the genuine skill over the synthetic copy.
- **Benchmark aggregation**: save each run's `grading.json` + `timing.json` under `eval-<N>/<config>/run-1/`. Write a Python aggregation script under the workspace and run it with `python3`.
- **Expo Go ceiling**: anything requiring custom native code (expo-module, App Clips, brownfield) cannot run in Expo Go. Use `static-only` mode for those — see `references/runtime-matrix.md` before writing eval cases for a skill (note: `@expo/ui` *does* run in Expo Go on SDK 56+).
- **API-route skills**: instead of a screenshot, verify with `curl` against the route while Metro is up; record the response as an output file for grading.
- **Timing data**: capture token counts and duration into `timing.json` immediately after each executor run — it is not recoverable later. To capture token counts, add `--output-format=stream-json --verbose` to the executor `claude -p` call and parse the `message_start` / `message_delta` events from the log. Without these flags the log only contains prose and elapsed seconds are the only recoverable metric.
- **First-launch dialogs**: Expo Go occasionally shows a one-time prompt on a fresh simulator. If a screenshot captures a dialog instead of the app, re-run the snapshot script (it reopens the URL) and re-capture.

## Viewer

After taking screenshots, always generate and open the HTML viewer so the user can see results immediately without being asked. The viewer is the checked-in `scripts/generate_viewer.py` — run it with the workspace root as its argument:

```bash
python3 /abs/path/expo-skill-eval/scripts/generate_viewer.py /private/tmp/expo-skill-eval-<skill>
```

It writes a self-contained `/private/tmp/expo-skill-eval-<skill>/viewer.html` and opens it in the browser itself (`webbrowser.open`). What it renders:
- A tab per iteration (`iteration-*` under the workspace root; remembers the last active tab in `localStorage`).
- For each eval case (read from `<iteration>/evals.json`): side-by-side with_skill / without_skill columns, each showing static-gate status, score, the platform screenshots (click to zoom; embedded as base64 `data:` URIs so the file is self-contained), the expectation list with PASS/FAIL badges, and reviewer notes.
- For **image-prompt cases** (a `grading.json` with `reference_match` / `quality`): the **target screenshot** beside the generated ones, the `reference_match` score (generated vs target), the `quality` rubric per config (one bar per dimension with its score/max plus the subtotal), and the **quality delta** (with_skill − without_skill subtotal) in the summary bar alongside the correctness delta.
- A summary bar with with_skill %, without_skill %, and delta.
- A trigger accuracy table when `trigger-evals/trigger_results.json` exists.
- A dark background with color-coded scores (green ≥85%, amber ≥65%, red below).

### Publishing the viewer (only if opted in up front)

The local `viewer.html` is always generated. **Only when the user chose "Publish a shareable Artifact"** in the up-front confirmation, additionally render it to a claude.ai Artifact at the very end — never publish without that opt-in (it's outward-facing and a published page can be cached/indexed). Mechanics:

- The `Artifact` tool wraps the file in its own `<!doctype html>…<head></head><body>` skeleton, so the file you hand it must be **page content only** — inline `<style>`/`<script>`, base64 `data:` images, and a `<title>`, but **no** `<!DOCTYPE>/<html>/<head>/<body>` tags of its own (a full standalone document gets double-wrapped and renders wrong).
- The script emits an Artifact-friendly variant when you add `--artifact`: `python3 /abs/path/expo-skill-eval/scripts/generate_viewer.py /private/tmp/expo-skill-eval-<skill> --artifact` writes `viewer_artifact.html` (same content, skeleton stripped, no browser open). Pass that file to the `Artifact` tool (`favicon: "📊"`), not the standalone one.
- The viewer is already self-contained (base64 screenshots, inline CSS/JS), so it satisfies the Artifact CSP (no external hosts).
